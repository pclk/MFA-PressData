Given the tensions in the Middle East, we continue to monitor the situation closely and will update our Travel Advisories and Notices accordingly. 3 Our Missions in the Middle East are in touch with the respective Singaporean communities. MFA also has been working with the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) and its Student Liaison Officers (SLOs) in Cairo and Jeddah to maintain contact with Singapore students pursuing religious studies in the region. This enables us to reach out and provide consular assistance quickly in any emergency. 4 Singaporeans in the Middle East should remain vigilant and monitor developments closely. They should also take all necessary precautions for their personal safety, purchase comprehensive travel insurance, and eRegister with MFA. As Singapore does not have resident diplomatic missions in all countries in the region, Singaporeans may also wish to familiarise themselves with the locations of the nearest Singapore Missions.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 8 MAY 2024"

ANSWER Singapore remains deeply concerned about the ongoing Israeli ground offensive into Rafah. The offensive will only worsen the already dire humanitarian situation and add to the immense suffering of the civilian population in Gaza. Singapore has consistently reiterated our concerns, and I have also made this clear in person to counterparts during my visit to the Middle East in March 2024. Singapore calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, and for the safe, immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Gaza. Thus far, Singapore has contributed three significant tranches of humanitarian materials for Gaza. The SAF also despatched personnel and assets to support humanitarian operations for Gaza. These include sending a medical team in January 2024 to support a French Armed Forces\u2019 hospital ship berthed in Egypt in providing medical aid and post operative nursing care to civilian casualties from Gaza; and deploying a C-130 at the invitation of the Jordanian government to air drop over 20 tonnes of food supplies into Gaza in March 2024. We will continue to contribute and remain in close contact with our regional partners and stakeholders on further humanitarian assistance needed for the civilians in Gaza. Singapore remains committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority\u2019s capacity-building efforts, including through our S$10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Programme (ETAP) for PA officials. Over 700 officials from the Palestinian Authority have come through the ETAP thus far, and we will continue to provide training assistance which has covered areas such as healthcare, water management and civil service training.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 8 MAY 2024"

REPLY 1 Southeast Asia has been affected by the escalation of armed conflicts in the Middle East since the Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on 7 October 2023, Israel\u2019s subsequent military response in Gaza and the consequential dire humanitarian situation. There is also a heightened risk of a wider regional conflagration with global economic impact. 2 In October 2023, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers issued a Statement on the Recent Escalation of Armed Conflict in the Middle East. They urged the \u201cimmediate end of violence to avoid further human casualties\u201d. Further, they called for \u201cthe full respect of International Humanitarian Law\u201d and for \u201csafe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian corridors\u201d. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers strongly condemned the \u201cacts of violence which have led to the deaths and injury of civilians, including ASEAN nationals\u201d. They called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. 3 In December 2023, all ASEAN Member States voted in favour of the United Nations General Assembly 10th Emergency Special Session resolution which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. Several ASEAN Member States, including Singapore, are also conveying urgently needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza. 4 Naturally, ASEAN Member States have different national perspectives. But on the core issues \u2013 the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, the need for humanitarian assistance to flow, and support for a two-state solution \u2013 ASEAN Member States share common views. With mutual understanding and respect, as well as a spirit of compromise, ASEAN has usually been able to find consensus on difficult issues. 5 On Singapore\u2019s part, we remain committed to ensuring that developments in the Middle East do not affect the close partnerships we share with fellow ASEAN Member States.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 8 MAY 2024"

Mr Christopher De Souza: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the impact of possible intense tension in the Middle East, arising from the scale of the drone attack by Iran, for Singapore. ANSWER Singapore is deeply concerned about the volatile situation in the Middle East. We have condemned the aerial attacks on Israel on 14 April 2024, which Iran stated was in response to an attack on its diplomatic premises in Damascus on 1 April 2024. These attacks exacerbate tensions and further destabilise an already tense region. We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid further escalatory actions. With the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the focus should be on securing an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages; and the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected civilians throughout Gaza. A wider conflict will have implications on the safety and security of everyone including Singaporeans living in the Middle East. Singaporean companies in the region will also be affected. More broadly, greater regional tensions will cause volatility to international energy markets, disrupt commercial aviation, and disrupt international supply chains.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 7 MAY 2024"

The Leaders\u2019 Retreat has been convened annually since 2016, with the exception of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This commitment to regular exchanges between the Leaders demonstrates the high-level attention paid to bilateral ties by both sides and the substantive cooperation that Singapore and Indonesia have developed over the years.\nThe Leaders welcomed the entry into force of the agreements under the Expanded Framework on 21 March 2024 as a historic milestone in bilateral relations. The Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR, the Treaty for the Extradition of Fugitives, and the Defence Cooperation Agreement have resolved three long-standing issues. The Leaders agreed that thesuccessful conclusion and entry into force of these agreements demonstrated that Singapore and Indonesia could address complicated issues in a pragmatic and mutually-beneficial manner when we commit to working together in a spirit of friendship and openness.

I am honoured to deliver the Sheth Distinguished Alumni Lecture today. a. Wonderful to be back on campus, and to see some familiar faces again. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) holds fond memories for me. a. I was last here in 1998, when I earned my Doctorate in Social Work. i. One of the most fruitful years of my academic career, owed in no small part to the dedication of the faculty as well as the intellectual rigour and curiosity shared among my fellow students. I recalled preparing for the demanding comprehensive examinations, as well as public defence of both my thesis proposal and dissertation. b. It was also here in UIUC that my eldest daughter Lidia was born, so it is extra special for my wife Sadiah and I to be back here today. i. Despite the extensive changes that we saw as we arrived, we were flooded with so many fond memories of UIUC, and it almost seemed as if we were just here yesterday. I am honoured and humbled to be receiving the 2023 Madhuri and Jagdish N. Sheth International Alumni Award for Exceptional Achievement later this evening. a. The breadth of experiences of the distinguished past recipients \u2013 ranging from government to the private sector and academia \u2013 speaks to the University\u2019s success in nurturing leaders who are able to give back in their own way to society. I understand that I will join the small minority of recipients as an elected politician, so I thought it would be apt for me to speak this afternoon about lessons of leadership from the perspective of a small state a. Specifically on key aspects of leadership that might seem small or be easily overlooked, but make an outsized impact when they are strategically steered. b. I will draw lessons from how Singapore\u2019s leaders led a fledgling nation into an uncertain future c. Singapore\u2019s journey as a country to find its place in the world d. My personal lessons as a political and community leader in Singapore. Before I start on the lecture proper, I thought it useful for me to give some context as to how I ended up as a politician. a. While in UIUC, I had already made up my mind on an academic career, afterall the National University of Singapore (NUS) had supported my studies and I was to spend the first 6 years upon graduating from UIUC serving my bond as an Assistant Professor at NUS. b. I started with that in mind. But three years into my academic career, I was invited by the ruling party in Singapore to join politics. i. I recall a social work professor once told me - the highest calling for a social worker is to serve his country in political office where he can make the most effective change and impact through sound policy making! ii. I heeded the call and as they say, the rest is history! Leading Singapore into an Uncertain Future Now let me begin my lecture proper. For those less familiar, Singapore is a small island state located at the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsula, with a land mass of less than 300 square miles or about 700 square kilometres. a. We are slightly smaller than New York City, but you will find us densely packed with a population of over 5.92 million people. b. More people can find us on a map now, but I recall that when I was studying at UIUC, parcels that I sent home were often stamped and delivered to China. People thought we were in China. And of course, it meant that my parcels took a longer time to reach home! Singapore was a country born out of necessity. a. Independence was thrust upon us, following our separation from Malaysia in 1965. b. One way to help contextualise this is if you imagine Chicago being ejected by Illinois, and having to become an independent, sovereign country overnight, with its own currency, its own defence force, and even its own international policy. Our challenges at independence were numerous and dire. a. And many predicted that we would not survive as a new country. It was against this ominous backdrop that Singapore\u2019s founding leaders fought hard to ensure the survival of a newly independent country. a. Yet, even as they focused on settling the most pressing problems of new nationhood (such as housing and educating its people, providing decent health care, creating economic opportunities and growth, building a defence force and uniting the people), what was remarkable was their ability to keep their sights on what Singapore could and should be. i. They connected the dots between various seemingly disparate policies, anchored them in the values that they hoped to instil in a young Singapore, and then mainstreamed, scaled and built on these policies so that they became sustainable and delivered long-term results. b. These are some of the key leadership ingredients that have helped Singapore become what it is today. Let me share three specific examples. Building a Singaporean Identity First, Singapore\u2019s leaders were acutely aware that one of their most pressing tasks was to build a common identity and sense of belonging in a disparate group of people. This was not an easy task for a few reasons a. Most of our people hailed from China, India and Peninsular Malaya, and did not have deep roots in Singapore. i. They spoke their own native language, practised their own faith and saw Singapore as a transient place to make money and go home thereafter. b. Interactions among the various ethnic groups had also been limited under British rule, with different races assigned to live in different parts of the island. c. This segregation and the lack of social cohesion made us a divided society even before independence i. With serious and violent racial riots breaking out in the late 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. Our leaders realised that for the Singapore endeavour to even have a chance of success, race and religion were societal faultlines that had to be addressed. One of the key decisions they took was to make English the country\u2019s working language, which included closing down vernacular language-based schools and making way for English medium public schools. a. This was not without initial opposition, with some in the private sector urging for Chinese to be Singapore\u2019s national and official language given our majority Chinese population. b. But our founding leaders pressed ahead i. Their decision allowed Singapore to enlarge its common space for all races, and avoid disadvantaging any ethnic group on the basis of language. ii. It also enabled Singapore to be able to transact with the rest of the world and make its mark on the international stage. As I reflected on these early years, what was clear was that foresight and fortitude are hallmarks of true leadership. Building a Nation Second, Singapore\u2019s leaders saw their work as going beyond the brick and mortar of simply enacting policies, but at its core, building a nation and its people. We see this clearly in Singapore\u2019s approach to housing its people \u2013 our public housing programme. a. When Singapore achieved self-government in 1959, home ownership stood at less than 10%. Many families lived in overcrowded slums and squatter colonies, which were unsafe and unsanitary. b. The Government\u2019s most pressing priority then was to improve the living conditions of its people. i. Our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was unambiguous and unwavering in his vision and conviction to uplift Singapore and the lives of Singaporeans, transforming Singapore from a mud flat to a metropolis. (1) His vision was bold, even audacious, and gave hope to a new people amid uncertain beginnings. ii. To house a young and growing nation, our Housing and Development Board (HDB) worked quickly to build entire townships comprising affordable and functional high-rise apartments, equipped with modern facilities like electricity and clean running water. (1) Within the first five years of independence, the Singapore government had built 53,000 apartments. (2) More than double what had been constructed in the 30 preceding years under the colonial government. c. However, the shift to public housing was not easy to implement. i. It involved the uprooting of entire communities from their single storey attap houses, or \u201ckampongs\u201d or villages, and moving them into unfamiliar high-rise apartments. (1) I myself, together with my parents and eight siblings, were uprooted at that time from the \u201ckampongs\u201d to a small 376 square feet, or 35 square metre apartment, which we rented from the government. ii. Many were unaccustomed to such a way of living, and some even brought the pigs and poultry which they had reared to their new apartments! iii. Nonetheless, our leaders stayed committed to their vision of transforming and housing a nation, and engaged tirelessly with the local communities to explain our housing policy and help with the necessary adjustments. d. Beyond putting a roof over people\u2019s heads, Singapore\u2019s leaders saw public housing as playing a pivotal role in building communities and strengthening our social fabric. i. Housing estates were built to promote interaction among residents from different income and social groups. ii. Common areas and shared facilities encouraged residents to mix and mingle. e. Crucially, we were also able to promote integration among the various races through public housing. i. For example, through the Ethnic Integration Policy, which prescribed the ideal ratio or balance of ethnic groups within each public housing block and estate. (1) Some would say that this was a drastic act of social engineering, but it has succeeded in fostering interactions among the different races in Singapore, promoting mutual understanding among Singaporeans, and preventing the formation of racial enclaves. ii. Public schools were also built within housing estates, so that young children of all races did not just live, but learn and grow up together. f. Beyond social integration, our leaders made home ownership a key tenet in Singapore\u2019s public housing policy. i. They saw it as critical in giving families stability, developing a sense of rootedness to Singapore, and to give Singaporeans a tangible stake in the country\u2019s survival and progress. ii. While many Singaporeans were renting public apartments in the early days, the Government made a strong push and introduced a suite of policies to promote home ownership, including the provision of mortgage financing by the government. (1) Today, more than 80% of Singaporeans live in HDB apartments, and 90% of them own the apartments they live in. With good economic growth, their property increased in value over time, providing them with a good nest-egg for their retirement needs. Another area where Singapore\u2019s nation-building approach is on display is education and human capital investment, which is a key pillar of our economic story given that our most valuable and precious \u201cnatural resource\u201d are our people. a. Many have marvelled at Singapore\u2019s economic successes over the years, but not so many appreciate the importance of education policies in supporting such achievements i. And the need for various government agencies, with different mandates, to come together and pursue broader policy objectives in the national interest. b. In Singapore, strategic manpower planning through education \u2013 or how we prepare skilled manpower through our education system and policies \u2013 is a key pillar of our growth. i. This is an area close to my heart as the Second Minister for Education ii. And is quite unique to Singapore given our small workforce and the need to regularly refresh our economic strategies so that we can tap into new growth areas and stay ahead of the curve. iii. Our economic agencies work very closely with the Ministries of Manpower and Education, to ensure that a steady pipeline of talent can be nurtured through our education system, to meet both the present and future needs of the Singapore economy. In this regard, the key to our leadership is a steadfast focus on our people \u2013 their development and social cohesion - this remains a cornerstone of our immediate and long-term policies. Building Stability The third aspect of leadership from the Singapore story is the importance of building stability. a. Our founding leaders understood clearly that beyond uniting Singaporeans as a people and undertaking the task of nation-building, Singapore would fail if we could not survive the troubled external environment, and seize opportunities to develop and prosper. 20. In our early days, Singapore did not have anything close to a credible defence force. a. Prior to independence, our defence lay in the hands of the British (under whom we were a colony) and Malaysia, when we were part of the Federation from 1963 to 1965. i. All we had at independence as a new nation were two infantry regiments, two wooden boats and two leased aircraft, and a thousand-strong People\u2019s Defence Force. ii. The British announcement of their withdrawal from East of the Suez and the departure of their troops from Singapore in 1971 were a serious blow to our national defence. Our leaders knew they had to quickly keep a newly independent Singapore safe and secure a. They introduced national service to build up a defence force from scratch. i. As part of national service, it was compulsory for every young Singaporean son at that time to serve about three years in the uniformed services. ii. This was a difficult policy to sell, since many parents in Asian culture preferred not to have their children serve in the military. (1) There was even a Chinese saying then in Singapore that \u201c\u597d\u94c1\u4e0d\u6253\u9489, \u597d\u6c49\u4e0d\u5f53\u5175\u201d (h\u01ceo ti\u011b b\u00f9 d\u01ce d\u00ecng, h\u01ceo h\u00e0n b\u00f9 d\u0101ng b\u012bng). (2) In English, it means \u201cgood sons do not become soldiers, just as good iron is not made into nails\u201d. iii. Our leaders worked tirelessly to explain the imperatives of national service and convince the public that this was necessary for Singapore\u2019s survival. (1) Leaders from the private sector, local community and grassroots were tasked to garner support. (2) Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew himself personally persuaded parents to entrust their sons to the armed forces, and even sitting Cabinet Ministers led by example and joined the People\u2019s Defence Force. iv. Today, national service has become a national institution and a part of Singaporeans\u2019 way of life (1) It has been embraced as a collective effort towards our national security, and has contributed to Singaporeans\u2019 sense of belonging and shared identity. As leaders, we not only need to have conviction in our decisions and strategies, but readiness and commitment to convince the people, as well as patience for the impact of policies to become evident and be embraced. Another key area to Singapore\u2019s survival was building economic progress and stability. a. Here, our founding leaders took the bold decision of adopting an open, outward-looking economic approach i. We pursued a strategy of rapid industrialisation, attracting investments from MNCs to create jobs and exports, which was a radical and untested approach at the time. It provided jobs and livelihoods for our people. ii. It was also contrary to the conventional wisdom then, that poor countries could achieve economic development through import substitution, and that MNCs were the new colonial powers out to exploit the impoverished Third World. iii. While newly independent nations were largely adopting protectionist policies, we went against the grain to open our borders to others. This strategy proved its worth, helping Singapore to create jobs and move up the value chain, and laying the foundations for the Singapore economy today. A common thread in the examples I have talked about so far was how our leaders were able to a. Pursue a vision that transcended the immediate problems facing a young nation. b. Give hope to a young population in what Singapore could become. c. And make a compelling case for Singaporeans to accept changes, and in some cases sacrifices, to achieve the greater good. The approach of a values-driven policy has enabled Singapore to avoid siloed and isolated policy approaches, and instead pursue and mainstream sustainable policies that have delivered long- term results. a. And as a young boy growing up in a newly independent Singapore, the visionary and courageous leadership of our founding leaders have made a real impact on my lived experiences, and inspired my own journey in public service. Leading Singapore into its Place in the World I would like to now turn to lessons in leadership from how Singapore establishes its place in the world. a. Just as how Singapore had to organise itself internally as it faced an uncertain future at independence, we also had to find our place on the international stage, particularly as a small state. To survive, we knew we had to mainstream ourselves from the margins. Singapore\u2019s foreign policy was forged amid tenuous and vulnerable beginnings. a. Our leaders possessed the self-awareness that small countries did not have intrinsic relevance. i. Small states are often perceived as performing no vital or irreplaceable function in the international system. b. This is why Singapore has continuously worked hard to make ourselves credible and relevant, so that other countries have an interest in our continued survival and prosperity as a sovereign and independent nation, and to create economic and political space internationally for ourselves. c. We are keenly aware that we cannot be all things to everyone, given the realities of our size and resources i. So we have sought to contribute and lead authentically in areas where we know we can make a contribution. 28. Singapore\u2019s foreign policy has thus been premised on the following principles: a. First, the protection of our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is paramount. b. Second, securing our access to essential supplies, energy, water and food, and to keep air and sea lines of communication open, which are existential for a trade-dependent country without a hinterland or natural resources. c. Third, expanding economic opportunities and maintaining our relevance to the world, by being nimble and adaptive in both creating and seizing opportunities.\nLet me highlight three key approaches undertaken by Singapore\u2019s leaders that have proved critical in Singapore\u2019s foreign policy Building Credibility and Relevance Firstbuilding credibility and relevance. Our early leaders understood that if Singapore were to have any relevance to the world, the Singapore model had to work \u2013 in other words, we needed to have a successful and vibrant economy. a. And as a small state, if we were not successful, and if we did not have a united society and stable politics, we would not be of interest to anyone. We also needed to be credible in our diplomacy, even from our early days of independence. a. Our views are taken seriously because our partners know that Singapore\u2019s leaders have always take a long-term constructive view on issues. b. And that Singapore is an honest broker that deals openly and fairly with all. i. Bigger countries engage us because we do not just tell them what they want to hear, we tell them what they need to hear. c. This sense of predictability has enabled Singapore to build up trust and goodwill with our partners over decades. Building Partnerships Second, as a small country, Singapore has to build partnerships and make common cause with as many countries as possible, while maintaining the freedom to be a sovereign and independent nation. a. This is especially so for our immediate neighbourhood, where peace and stability in Southeast Asia is absolutely critical. Let me speak here about ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is a cornerstone of our foreign policy a. ASEAN is a grouping of 10 member states in Southeast Asia. b. It was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War, when the region was a proxy battleground for the major powers i. The Vietnam War was in full swing, and there were concerns that a communist victory against American forces in Indochina would mean that the rest of us in Southeast Asia were next in line to fall. ii. Relations between some ASEAN Member States were tense. Amid this difficult geopolitical environment, the founding five ASEAN member states, led by then-PM Lee Kuan Yew, Indonesian President Suharto, Malaysian PM Tunku Abdul Rahman, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and Thai PM Thanom Kittikachorn, recognised that they had to set aside bilateral issues and differences for the greater good, and focus on ensuring stability and security, long-term strategic development and regional economic integration. a. In the words of Singapore\u2019s first Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam on the occasion of ASEAN\u2019s founding, \u201cif we do not hang together, we will hang separately\u201d. Over the past six decades, ASEAN has not only succeeded in keeping the peace a. But has performed spectacularly by going further to integrate all 10 of our economies, pursuing cooperation in new and emerging areas such as the digital and green economies. b. And providing an open and inclusive platform for its members to engage with the major powers and have a common voice on key issues facing the region. Beyond the immediate Southeast Asian region, Singapore has built a wide network of friends and partners around the world, to pursue collaboration and create opportunities for our people. a. The US is one such partner with whom we share an important relationship. b. The US\u2019 enduring presence in the Asia-Pacific has underpinned Southeast Asia\u2019s peace and prosperity for the past several decades. i. It was the US security presence at the height of the Cold War that bought Southeast Asian countries time and space to develop, and proved that free market economics and globalisation worked c. The US is also the largest source of foreign investment in Southeast Asia i. With more investments in Southeast Asia than in China, Japan, South Korea and India combined ii. And with American companies providing useful know-how and best business practices to the region. 38. Bilaterally, Singapore and the United States share an excellent and growing relationship. a. Our economic ties are robust, underpinned by the US-Singapore FTA \u2013 the US\u2019 first FTA with an Asian country \u2013 which marks its 20th anniversary this year. b. We also cooperate very closely on the defence and security fronts. c. We have expanded our partnership into new and emerging areas, including critical and emerging technologies, cybersecurity and climate change. 39. Singapore has been a longstanding supporter of a US that is actively engaged in our region. a. In fact, when US forces had to leave the Clark and Subic bases in the Philippines in the early 1990s, it was Singapore that facilitated the US forces\u2019 access to our air and naval bases, underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding signed by our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and then-United States Vice President Dan Quayle in 1990. i. We did so because we believed that the US should not disengage from Southeast Asia. i. Today, the US is the largest foreign user of Singapore\u2019s Changi Naval Base and the Paya Lebar Air Base. b. In this current uncertain and challenging geopolitical environment, we continue to believe that the US\u2019 sustained presence is critical to the region\u2019s peace, stability and prosperity i. We see the US as a Pacific power, with longstanding equities in Southeast Asia. ii. And it is in all of our interests for the US to remain actively engaged in our region. Building our Place in the World Third, as a small state building its place in the world, the rules-based multilateral system and respect for the sanctity of international law are existential issues for us. a. It is the only way that a small country can have the chance to survive; the alternative is a world \u201cwhere the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\u201d. Singapore continues to do its part to contribute to the multilateral governance of the global commons and international legal frameworks. a. For example, we were proud to have contributed to the adoption of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is also known as the constitution for the oceans, with a Singaporean \u2013 Ambassador Tommy Koh \u2013 serving as President of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea which adopted the convention. b. More recently, we played a significant role in developing the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement, with another Singaporean \u2013 Ambassador Rena Lee \u2013 presiding over the negotiations on the treaty, which will enhance the sustainable use of our maritime global commons. We have also engaged widely and actively with multilateral groups to prepare for common challenges. a. For example, we founded and remain the convenor of the Forum of Small States (FOSS), an informal grouping of countries at the UN with populations under 10 million. It was founded in 1992 with 16 countries and has since grown to 108-strong. The FOSS provides a platform for small states to discuss issues of common concern and amplify their views at the UN. Engagement at all levels Ultimately, foreign policy is not just about high-level diplomacy a. It is also about establishing your place in the world by choosing the space where you can make genuine contributions. b. And cultivating relationships at all levels to build for Singapore a deep reservoir of goodwill and trust. i. A constant work, in the words of the late Secretary of State George Shultz, of \u201ctending the diplomatic garden\u201d. As the Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, I regularly visit and engage counterparts in Southeast Asia, particularly the countries in our immediate vicinity \u2013 Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. a. I meet widely \u2013 from calling on Sultans and Ministers to engaging local governors, businessmen and students, and make it a point to visit provinces and cities outside of the capital. b. These interactions not only help to put Singapore on the map and in the minds of people in our region, but crucially deepen our understanding of our counterparts, their interests and the realities on the ground. c. And help uncover opportunities for closer collaboration. The Middle East is another key example of the importance of active and sustained engagement. a. It is an especially pertinent region for Singapore, given its strategic location on global trade routes and economic potential. b. And for our domestic Muslim minority population, some of whom trace their ancestry back to the region. Our Arab partners appreciate the effort that Singapore takes in engaging them, even though we are geographically quite far away. a. My numerous visits to the Middle East have built familiarity and trust, and facilitated frank and insightful exchanges of views with my counterparts. b. It is also this reservoir of goodwill that helped facilitate our work with our Middle Eastern partners last month, to conduct humanitarian airdrop operations to deliver aid to Gaza. This was our third tranche of aid. We will continue to do more to support the humanitarian effort for civilians in Gaza. Our partners in the Middle East appreciate that we have also not shied away from speaking out on issues that are important to us. a. One recent example is the Israel-Hamas conflict. i. Singapore has condemned the acts by Hamas as a blatant and abhorrent act of terrorism and recognised Israel\u2019s right to self-defence. ii. But we have also consistently called on Israel to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, which necessitates that its conduct must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality. (1) Unfortunately, Israel\u2019s military response has gone too far. iii. The catastrophic and dire situation in Gaza demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, to alleviate the suffering of civilians and to enable humanitarian assistance to reach those in need. iv. We have taken a clear and consistent position on the matter, and conveyed the same message to Israeli and Arab leaders last month during Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s visit to the region. v. The current conflict in Gaza is part of that never-ending tragedy that is the Israel-Palestinian conflict. We must break the cycle of violence. Ultimately both Israeli and Palestinian leaders need to have the moral courage to resume direct negotiations towards a two-state solution, consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. As difficult as it may be under the current circumstances, this is the only way for both sides to live in enduring peace and security. In raising our key foreign policy principles and approaches, I wanted to emphasise that for a small state establishing its place in the world, the work of reinforcing Singapore\u2019s relevance, forging partnerships and upholding the multilateral system is critical to our survival. a. We have limited resources as a small country, but we seek to lead authentically in areas where we have strengths and can add value, such as maritime governance and biodiversity. i. Our partners see us as constructive and serious-minded, and know that we can be counted on. ii. We also seek to expand our political and economic space, as establishing open links with regional and global partners is critical to Singapore\u2019s continued growth, attracting investments and expanding trade. iii. We engage widely with multilateral groups to prepare for common challenges and amplify our collective voices, and forge a wide network of economic agreements to expand Singapore\u2019s economic space and create new opportunities for our people. Personal Lessons as a Leader in Singapore As I look back on my political career of over two decades, I am reminded of the saying I learnt while in UIUC \u2013 that \u201call politics is local\u201d. a. Our work is at the end of the day all about people. i. It is about the ability to understand the concerns of the man and woman on the street, helping to find solutions to their problems, and explaining and securing buy-ins for government policies, domestically and internationally. b. It is easier said than done. It involves countless hours walking the ground, forming genuine connections with Singaporeans from all stations in life and understanding diverse perspectives, even if they may run contrary to my own. c. But beyond that, it is also about community. It is about making sure that no one is left behind, and that opinions are heard and discussed. On a personal level, a few key lessons have stood out to me over the course of my political career and are worth sharing today. Being present Firstbeing present. a. As a Member of Parliament, one of my main responsibilities is to serve as a bridge between my constituents and the Government, by ensuring that their concerns are heard in Parliament. i. This requires me to be present for my constituents, to be aware of their needs, concerns and aspirations. ii. I take the time to meet my constituents once a week through Meet-the-People (MPS) sessions. (1) Each session lasts for several hours in the evening, outside of my full-time duties as a Minister (2) It is a very valuable time where I can address the needs of and problems raised by my residents (3) It also allows me to take pulse of the community and what their pressing concerns are (4) And where appropriate, raise some of these concerns in Parliament, even if they may be uncomfortable issues but are issues that need to be addressed. Being accessible Second, being accessible. a. It is important for a leader to be connected to the ground b. And for people to be able to see that there is empathy, that their needs will be heard and understood, and most importantly, acted on. c. Here I cannot stress enough the importance of walking the ground, i.e. a leader being among the people. i. For me, the term applies quite literally, as my grassroot leaders\u2019 and my weekends are spent going from door-to-door to meet residents to connect with them and understand what they are going through. ii. We also make time to visit small business owners and attend community events, and I meet smaller groups at the community level to share and gather feedback on government policies, ensuring that these are relevant and understood, and recommend policy adjustments where necessary. iii. Through interactions like these, trust and understanding is built. Being accountable Third, being accountable. a. It is not enough to merely be present and accessible to the people. b. At the end of the day, all leaders will need to deliver results. i. As the elected representative of my constituents, I am continuously looking for ways in which I can tangibly improve the lives of my community. ii. Being able to make a difference in the welfare of my constituents is one of the greatest satisfactions of the role. iii. One of the more memorable local projects that I led recently was the building of an integrated community care centre, or community club, in the Siglap area that I represent. (1) It is a multi-use development that provides a space for the community to interact, including through the conduct of various courses and recreational sporting facilities. (2) But it is important to note that at its heart, it is about the people (a) And it has become a prime example of an area that brings together people of all races, ages and from different walks of life \u2013 from homemakers coming together to attend cooking classes, to fitness enthusiasts bonding over their shared love for sports, to vulnerable seniors brought together to network and prevent social isolation. (3) I am also immensely proud that this was a project by the people for the people, with the local community pitching in strongly with ideas on what the centre should look like and raising funds for its construction. Being Inspirational Fourth, being inspirational. a. Leaders do not lead alone. To lead in building a community, I depend on an army of volunteers whom we call grassroots leaders. They seek opportunities to contribute to the community. But they also look up to leaders who can inspire them to go beyond themselves. b. Leaders thus inspire through their deeds \u2013 showing what it means to serve with sincerity and genuineness. I do so every moment I spent serving my constituents. c. My grassroots community leaders include youth, professionals, business owners, homemakers and retirees. i. They manage neighbours\u2019 disputes, organise community activities, mentor disadvantaged children, and befriend vulnerable seniors \u2013 the list goes on. ii. All because they say they have been inspired by a leader who shows them what it means to make a difference in the lives of their fellow citizens. When Leadership matters \u2013 dealing with difficult moments There have also been difficult moments as a leader, where I had to step in to explain the Government\u2019s position and assuage my community\u2019s concerns on sensitive issues such as religion. a. One example would be the issue of Muslim women wearing the \u201ctudung\u201d, or religious headscarves in public institutions and workplaces as part of attire or uniform policy. To assure everyone, Muslim women in Singapore are free to put on their headscarves in accordance to and as an expression of their faith in all aspects of private, community and official settings. b. The issue of uniformed attire in work settings has attracted public discussion for some time, and surfaced again in 2020 when a Muslim woman was asked to remove her tudung before she could continue her work as a promoter at a departmental store as it was not aligned with the store\u2019s policy on attire for its employees. i. While the store\u2019s decision was subsequently reversed, the episode elicited a strong reaction and sparked online discussion, particularly among the Malay Muslim community \u2013 of which I am a part of. ii. At the heart of the issue was the delicate balance that Singapore had to strike in maintaining a national identity shared by all, while allowing the practise of different faiths and cultures. (1) To give some context, Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where different races and faiths live peacefully and closely together. (2) Our racial and religious harmony is based on treating everyone equally without prejudice or discrimination, and building a national identity shared by all communities, while allowing each community to practise its faith and way of life. (3) We have over time, through mutual accommodation and trust building by all groups, reached a delicate balance that considers the interest of all communities. c. My fellow community leaders and I have worked hard to engage the Malay Muslim community on the issue i. Through closed-door dialogues where concerns and views could be shared in an open and candid manner ii. And by working closely with religious leaders to facilitate understanding of the religious obligations surrounding the tudung (1) Including guidance from Muslim scholars that appropriate adjustments could and should be made, while staying true to one\u2019s faith when living in a plural and contemporary society. d. Our conversations with the Muslim community on the issue were not one-way, but also involved listening and taking in their concerns and feedback. i. The Government recognised that the balance that we had reached in building a national identity was a dynamic one, and that the socio-religious significance of the tudung to Muslim Singaporeans was growing. ii. We therefore announced a policy revision in 2021 such that female Muslim nurses in Singapore\u2019s public healthcare sector could wear the tudung at work if they wished to do so. (1) This was well received by the Muslim community, and seen as a step in the right direction. (2) It further demonstrated the willingness on the part of both the Government and the Muslim community to find common ground and address concerns collaboratively. It is important to note that leadership is multidimensional. a. Leaders themselves are on a journey of learning and understanding. i. This is an important aspect of one\u2019s development as a leader \u2013 being open to tackling tough issues as they arise through discovery, dialogue and decision-making. At the personal level, leadership to me is defined by one\u2019s lived experiences, the values you bring to the table, and the changes you can realistically and sustainably effect. a. As I raised earlier, leaders must be present, accessible and accountable to the communities they represent and inspire others to co-lead and build communities and society. i. They should also be willing to listen before speaking, be committed to delivering results, and to constantly learn, evolve and improve with time. Having been born in the same year as Singapore\u2019s independence, I have been fortunate to have had a ringside seat to the Singapore Story. a. Particularly the key decisions taken by our founding leaders, which had an outsized impact on the trajectory of a new nation. b. Their experiences in walking the talk and engaging Singaporeans to secure buy-in for difficult policies such as national service. c. And how these policies have translated to real tangible changes to the lived experiences of Singaporeans from all walks of life. d. My own story is an example of how the bold and visionary leadership of Singapore\u2019s founding government gave a boy from the \u201ckampong\u201d or village the opportunity to be the first in his family to go to college, embark on a life of public service and to stand before you today. Conclusion I hope my sharing this afternoon has provided you a perspective of a. Singapore\u2019s journey as a fledging country and the importance of anchoring nation-building policies to a broader values-driven core, such that these policies were not pursued in silos but were sustainable and yielded long-term results. b. How, as a small country, Singapore is establishing its place in the world, and the importance of building credibility, relevance and partnerships, upholding multilateralism and leading authentically in areas where we can make a contribution. Indeed, mainstreaming itself from the margins. c. And on a more personal level, the importance of being present, accessible, and accountable as a leader and in the process, inspiring others to also go through the leadership journey. Many of you here today are leaders in your own right, whether it be in your community, your work or your daily lives. a. As I highlighted in the example of Singapore, we may often find ourselves coming from different backgrounds, upbringings and ethnic makeups. We may also come with varying perspectives, cultures, and beliefs. b. We should embrace these differences. It makes each and every one of us unique and improves the quality of our conversations, our lived experiences, and our depth of perspective. c. Singapore is but one of many examples of how people can live harmoniously together. But as leaders, we need to and can do more. i. We need to bridge gaps, bring communities together, and embrace our differences, domestically, regionally and internationally. We need to be present, accessible and accountable to the communities we represent, inspire others to co-lead and deliver realistic and sustainable improvements in their lives. And we need to proactively do so. We owe it to ourselves as leaders to put that foot forward. I hope that my sharing also encourages you to pay a visit to Singapore if you have never visited before. We would be delighted to welcome you. Finally, I would like to thank the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for this honour to speak to you today, and for the conferment of the 2023 Madhuri and Jagdish N. Sheth International Alumni Award for Exceptional Achievement. a. Thank you to the benefactors Dr Jagdish and Mrs Madhuri Sheth for making this award possible. True to the spirit of the award which acknowledges the contributions of UIUC alumni in the realms of government, humanity, science, art, and human welfare, I commit to continue serving and living out the leadership values that have brought me this far in my career. . Allow me to also express my deepest appreciation to my wife Sadiah who is here with us today - for her unstinting support, unconditional love and selfless sacrifice during our lives together for the past 32 years, including sacrificing her career to accompany me here in UIUC when I was pursuing my doctoral studies. She personifies true leadership \u2013 always putting others before self. And from her, I have learnt the true meaning of leadership. Thank you Sayang. Thank you once again everyone for your kind attention."

I am glad to be back in the Philippines. This is a very timely visit. As you can see, we are celebrating 55 years of diplomatic relations between two nations, close bond of trust, very tight people-to-people relations, and of course, both the Philippines and Singapore were also founding members of ASEAN. I am also very glad and honoured that I had a chance to have a meeting with President Marcos yesterday evening, and to be followed by our in-depth discussion that we just had this morning.\nSingapore businesses are confident in the prospects of the Philippines\u2019 economic growth. In fact, Singapore has been one of the top investors in the Philippines, and this is not just last year, but for the past several years. It is a vote of confidence in the Filipino people and in the Philippine economy. Our investments from Singapore businesses have included areas like real estate, hospitality, telecommunications, transport, and logistics, and in fact, tomorrow I am taking the opportunity to visit Clark, where I believe Singapore businesses such as SIA Engineering (Philippines) and the Changi Airports International have also established a presence.\nBoth our nations are also keen to strengthen collaboration in future-oriented areas, including the green economy, smart and sustainable infrastructure, innovation, start-ups and opportunities, especially for the many young people that the Philippines has. In particular, there are two areas I wanted to highlight today, one on carbon credits and second on energy collaboration.\nDuring my discussion with Secretary Manalo, just now, we talked about the establishment of a carbon credits market that is compliant with Article Six of the Paris Agreement. I believe this is in the mutual interests of both our countries, given the global need to transit towards net carbon zero. The Philippines, in my view, has great potential in this area, and Singapore and the Philippines can work together on a framework for the trading of carbon credits. This will open up new growth areas and opportunities for the Philippine economy, whilst expanding Singapore's businesses access to the available carbon credits that would be generated.\nWe also discussed energy collaboration at a regional level. For instance, the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) has demonstrated that it is possible to have cross-border energy trade between ASEAN member states. In this part of the world, the connection between the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei is another critical pillar. And if you put these two networks together, you in fact, get the beginning of a very significant ASEAN power grid. And it just so happens that the Philippines is also chair of the ASEAN Power Grid Consultative Committee, and we look forward to working closely with the Philippines to make the ASEAN Power Grid a reality. Singapore and the Philippines will also work closely together in other emerging areas of energy, which we discussed. And as I said earlier, this will be a learning journey for both of us as we transit into the economic and energy transformations and also the transformative power of artificial intelligence. There is no shortage of areas which we can work on for the future.\nI thank you [Secretary Manalo] for your extensive brief about the situation in the South China Sea. Singapore has been a longstanding advocate of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We believe this sets out a comprehensive international legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas should be carried out. As a tiny city state, Singapore has to believe in the importance of the international rule of law. If it is just the law of the jungle, where the powerful do what they will and the weak must suffer what they must, then the future will be very bleak for Singapore and the Philippines. Singapore has been watching recent developments in the South China Sea with concern. Singapore is not a claimant state in the South China Sea, and we do not take sides in the competing territorial and maritime claims. We hope that all parties will maintain open channels of communication, will preserve regional peace and stability, and ensure adherence to international law, including (and) especially (the) 1982 UNCLOS. As a small, trade-dependent city state, Singapore\u2019s interest is in maintaining peace and stability in one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways, which is what the South China Sea is. We uphold the right of all states to freedom of navigation and overflight and support the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including UNCLOS. ASEAN and China are currently working on negotiating what we hope will be an effective and substantive Code of Conduct on the South China Sea, which will be in accordance with international law and UNCLOS. It will safeguard the rights and interests of all parties in the South China Sea. I am pleased that we have made some progress so far. We are now in the third reading of the single draft negotiating text. Although, quite frankly, it is hard to say when the negotiations will conclude, given the complex nature of the issues. We continue to encourage all parties to participate actively in the negotiations and in the practical maritime cooperation initiatives established under the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.\nWe also had discussions on concerns in the Middle East. For both the Philippines and Singapore, I think we stand for peace. We hope that despite the fact that this is perhaps an intractable problem, nevertheless, if all parties can seek to de-escalate tensions, can find a way to protect civilians, release all hostages immediately and unconditionally, and then find a way to create a formulation in which the two states, Palestine and Israel, will be able to live in peace and dignity. Because we cannot see any other alternative to avoiding these recurrent cycles of violence which have gone on for far too long. We also discussed the recent escalation from the aerial attacks that were launched by Iran, apparently in response to what they said was an attack on a diplomatic facility. These escalations pose significant danger to a regional conflagration, which ultimately will also impact all of us here in Southeast Asia. So we hope for the best. Again, I thank you for this opportunity to consult closely with you and with your team, in a way which we can only do so because of the large reservoir of trust, and goodwill, and mutual confidence. Thank you, Secretary Manalo.\nModerator: Thank you, Minister Balakrishnan. In the interest of time, we will go straight to the questions and answers. We will entertain only one direct question for the Minister and one direct question for Secretary.\nQ&A\nGMA Integrated News: Good afternoon. Hello Foreign Minister Balakrishnan. Welcome to Manila. I am JP from GMA news. ASEAN has been very vocal on regional issues concerning peace and security, including conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, as you mentioned. As one of ASEAN founding members, why is ASEAN not unified in condemning China for its concerning actions in the South China Sea that impact our region's peace and stability? How important is it for ASEAN to have a unified, united voice on the South China Sea dispute and in calling out China's aggressive behaviour? How will the upcoming leadership change in Singapore influence this stance?\nMinister: Let me answer the simpler question first. Yes, there will be a leadership transition in Singapore on 15 May. I do not expect any change in foreign policy, in our contributions to ASEAN, and the ongoing cooperation, projects, investments and the further deepening of the relationship with the Philippines. On the South China Sea and ASEAN, I have explained it earlier. First point is, note that not all ASEAN states are claimant states, or are necessarily party to the overlapping claims and maritime entitlements in the South China Sea. It is important to understand that. The second point is that does not mean ASEAN as a whole has no stake in what happens in the South China Sea. As I explained just now, the most important thing for the whole of ASEAN is to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, because not only is it in our immediate backyard, but it is also one of the world's busiest waterways. Although Singapore has got no claims in the South China Sea, the moment you have escalation of tension, or collisions, or worse, military action in the South China Sea, it will immediately impair and impede trade. It will increase insurance premiums. It will certainly have an inflationary impact on our economies. And it will dampen confidence in what in fact, should be multiple decades of growth and progress that we all expect and that our people need in order for us to achieve the economic transformation and the expansion in jobs. The first point is peace and stability are paramount.\nSecond point is that we should recognise that questions of sovereignty, in fact, are very difficult to resolve. It may sometimes take more than one generation to resolve. Disputes over sovereignty do not necessarily have to lead the conflict or kinetic action in the waves of the South China Sea. We continue to advocate for peaceful resolution of disputes, for avoiding the use of or threat of force to resolve these very difficult, long-term problems.\nOn the point of maritime entitlements, we believe UNCLOS sets out a comprehensive statement of how maritime entitlements should be established, maintained and the responsibilities for all parties. So, you will notice that ASEAN has always upheld the primacy, the importance of UNCLOS. Sometimes people refer to it as a constitution for the oceans. I think on that, there is no question. ASEAN is certainly united on the importance of UNCLOS.\nThe third aspect is to maintain ASEAN unity and the centrality of ASEAN. Now, this is not just a form of words, because you need to understand that ASEAN has got ten members and in the future, 11. We represent the most diverse regional grouping in the world, in terms of size, economic development, political structures, and demographics. It is complex, it is variegated. It also means that in our relations to the superpowers, both superpowers and to the middle powers, like India, Australia, Europe, if you look carefully at each member of ASEAN, each of us may have slightly different levels of proximity in terms of strategic alignment with one or the other. But I believe ASEAN is united in the sense that no single ASEAN country wants to become a proxy, or a vassal state of any power. So, you need to be able to deal with this variety, internally, as well as the diversity of our approaches externally, but still recognise that we want to maintain unity, cohesion and centrality of ASEAN. One example of this is the negotiations for the Code of Conduct, which is being conducted as ASEAN on one hand, with China on the other hand. Now, the Code of Conduct will not resolve issues of sovereignty, or maritime entitlement. But it is important nevertheless, because we believe it is one way to reduce tension and to reduce the possibility of complications, if collisions or disputes occur in the way of the South China Sea. So, in short, I would put to you that in fact, ASEAN has been successful. ASEAN does represent an organisation which is able to encompass the great diversity of membership and still maintain sufficient discipline, coherence and relevance in maintaining peace and stability, and to focus on economic integration, and in expanding the range of strategic opportunities for every single member of ASEAN. So, thank you for that question.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan had a breakfast meeting with House of Representatives Rachel Arenas and Loreto Archaron.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan had a breakfast meeting with House of Representatives Rachel Arenas and Loreto Archaron.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan met with Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo today and unveiled a logo commemorating 55 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the Philippines.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan called on Vice President and Secretary of Education Sara Duterte today.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hosted Prime Minister Rt Hon Christopher Luxon on an Official Visit to Singapore from 14 to 16 April 2024. Prime Minister Lee welcomed Prime Minister Luxon on his first official engagement in Singapore. Both Prime Ministers acknowledged the deep historical connections and wide-ranging cooperation between Singapore and New Zealand across a range of fields, and shared regional and global interests and outlooks addressing common challenges. 2. Prime Minister Luxon acknowledged the significant contributions made by Prime Minister Lee to deepening ties between the two countries, and the deep and enduring legacy Prime Minister Lee will leave for Southeast Asia and the wider region. The Singapore-New Zealand Enhanced Partnership 3. The Prime Ministers highlighted significant developments made in the Enhanced Partnership between Singapore and New Zealand that continues to underpin the strategic relationship between the two countries in the five years since its launch in 2019. The Enhanced Partnership currently covers five pillars: a) Trade and Economics; b) Security and Defence; c) Science, Technology and Innovation; d) People-to-People Links; and e) Climate Change and Green Economy. 4. The Prime Ministers committed to strengthening cooperation in the next phase of the relationship under the Enhanced Partnership. They agreed that both sides should look to expand practical cooperation in priority areas of food security, supply chains, the green economy, digital, critical and emerging technology, and engagement on Pacific issues and efforts to advocate for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The Prime Ministers agreed to elevate the relationship by the 60th Anniversary of the establishment of Singapore-New Zealand diplomatic relations in 2025. Economic Resilience and Supply Chains 5. The Prime Ministers noted the challenging geostrategic environment and growing protectionism impacting both countries\u2019 shared core interests in building resilient supply chains and protecting food security. They reaffirmed the joint commitment by Singapore and New Zealand as trusted friends to work together during times of crisis, recalling the close cooperation during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep supply chains open. The Prime Ministers welcomed progress under the Supply Chain Working Group launched in 2022. 6. To reflect the importance of economic resilience for future prosperity and security, the Prime Ministers agreed to add a sixth pillar on \u201cSupply Chains and Connectivity\u201d to the Enhanced Partnership. Under the pillar, the Prime Ministers announced a package of new initiatives to further strengthen supply chain connectivity and food security, expand commercial partnerships in food and agriculture, promote investment opportunities, and strengthen cooperation on cross-border trade facilitation matters. A list of agreed initiatives is in the Annex. Under the new pillar, the Prime Ministers agreed to launch negotiations for an Agreement on Trade in Essential Supplies. The Agreement builds on the close cooperation on the Singapore-New Zealand Declaration on Trade in Essential Goods for Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic and aims at a higher level of ambition for a stronger bilateral supply chain relationship. The Agreement will become part of the Singapore-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership. Climate Change and Green Economy 7. The Prime Ministers recognise the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and support the global economic transition that is under way as part of their shared commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and seize growth opportunities in the green economy. New Zealand and Singapore will work together to ensure their economies are prosperous, clean, and future-proofed. 8. The Prime Ministers noted the good progress made implementing the \u201cClimate Change and Green Economy\u201d pillar launched in 2022. Singapore\u2019s role as a regional green finance and carbon services hub complements New Zealand's role as an investment destination for clean energy production and a test bed for sustainable technologies. 9. The global low emissions transition presents opportunities to drive economic growth and innovation. The Prime Ministers agreed that Singapore and New Zealand would further enhance cooperation under the Climate Change and Green Economy pillar. The Prime Ministers directed officials to explore how New Zealand and Singapore will cooperate to promote commercial partnerships in achievement of their respective climate change and economic transition goals. This could include Green Economy focused business missions to Singapore and New Zealand to identify opportunities for collaboration in areas such as energy and transport technology, and cooperation on finance and investment including carbon markets. 10. The Prime Ministers agreed that Singapore and New Zealand would further enhance cooperation in sustainable aviation and shipping, as well as collaborate to advance green customs issues. They acknowledged the opportunity for Singapore and New Zealand to be pathfinders in developing international frameworks to drive net zero transition and economic growth. 11. New Zealand and Singapore are both committed to ambitious implementation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Clean Economy Agreement. Officials intend to explore collaboration to identify concrete ways IPEF can deliver for the small economies participating, such as through the IPEF Cooperative Work Programmes. Defence and Security 12. Building on a deep history of cooperation dating back to the Second World War, the Prime Ministers agreed that New Zealand and Singapore will continue to strengthen defence and security cooperation including through high-level dialogues, training, military exercises, professional exchanges, and cooperation at multilateral fora. The Prime Ministers welcomed the 50th Anniversary of New Zealand Force South East Asia (NZFORSEA) reflecting New Zealand\u2019s longstanding engagement supporting peace and security in the region. The Prime Ministers affirmed their commitment to the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) and to the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting (ADMM)-Plus. 13. The Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction that Singapore\u2019s unilateral live firing artillery exercise hosted in New Zealand, Exercise Thunder Warrior, will recommence in 2025. The Prime Ministers were pleased that New Zealand is renewing its mandate for the Counter Terrorism Information Facility. 14. On security cooperation, the Prime Ministers noted the strong ongoing cooperation in cyber security, border security, and law enforcement. Science, Innovation and Technology 15. The Prime Ministers were pleased with the progress made on science, research, and innovation collaboration, including ongoing joint research projects between Singapore and New Zealand universities and research institutes in the areas of data science and future foods. Both countries will explore collaboration opportunities such as a second phase of the Singapore-New Zealand joint research programme in future foods and in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Prime Ministers also noted opportunities for potential cooperation on innovative technologies in frontier areas, which agencies would explore in the next phase of the Enhanced Partnership. Regional Economic and Trade Cooperation 16. The Prime Ministers welcomed the development of stronger economic linkages between Singapore and New Zealand and reaffirmed their shared commitment to upholding the rules-based trading system and promoting resilient supply chains. Both countries welcomed the signing of the Second Protocol to Amend the Agreement establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) and will continue to work together on the ongoing implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement. New Zealand and Singapore support the expansion of existing agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) to include economies that are willing and able to fully adhere to the agreements\u2019 high standards. 17. Singapore and New Zealand remain committed to the CPTPP vision of connecting Asia, the Americas and the Pacific via trade and investment and the CPTPP\u2019s important role as the vehicle for driving economic integration in the region and beyond. New Zealand and Singapore will work together on the ongoing expansion and upgrading of the agreement through the accession and General Review processes, so that it remains fit-for-purpose and the benefits to CPTPP Members can continue to grow. 18. The Prime Ministers also noted the importance of enhancing collaboration with partners across the Indo-Pacific region in implementing the new 14-country agreements on Supply Chains, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy under the IPEF. Both countries look forward to working closely together with IPEF partners. 19. Prime Minister Lee welcomed New Zealand\u2019s commitment to step up and deepen engagement in the Southeast Asian region, with both Prime Ministers recognising ongoing opportunities for New Zealand and Singaporean companies to work together to support growth of exports and services to Southeast Asia, South Asia, and beyond. Global Developments 20. The Prime Ministers also exchanged views on regional and global developments. 21. The Prime Ministers once again condemned in the strongest terms Russia\u2019s illegal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine over two years since it began. They noted their ongoing commitment to supporting Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the global impact of Russia\u2019s aggression, including on food and energy security in the Indo-Pacific region. They reiterated their support for a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter. The Prime Ministers called on all those with influence on Russia to exert this now to convince Russia to abide by its international obligations, withdraw troops from within Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders, and then enter diplomatic negotiations as a pathway to resolution of the conflict. 22. The Prime Ministers reiterated their shared commitment to a prosperous, open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which supports and promotes free trade and open markets, and respects the rights of countries to lead their national existence free from external interference, subversion and coercion. They reaffirmed the fundamental importance of ASEAN Centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) to the region, and agreed to continue to work closely with ASEAN in ASEAN-led mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum, including on cooperative projects under the four priority areas of the AOIP. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the unique value of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), where Singapore and New Zealand collaborate closely on a range of trade and economic issues that are contributing to a more integrated and prosperous region, including on issues such as the green economy, digitalisation and trade facilitation. They also reaffirmed their shared determination to strengthen the WTO and the rules-based multilateral trading system.\n23. In the maritime domain, the Prime Ministers expressed concern over developments in the South China Sea and reaffirmed the right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas accorded by international law particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They reaffirmed the need for all states to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, including dispute settlement mechanisms. The Prime Ministers reiterated that UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. They further affirmed the need to respect states\u2019 ability to conserve, sustainably develop, and effectively manage their maritime natural resources in accordance with international law, in particular UNCLOS. They reaffirmed that all concerned parties must abide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterated their support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS. They also affirmed the importance of acting consistently with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization. 24. The Prime Ministers condemned ongoing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea as illegal and called on the Houthi to cease immediately their attacks on international shipping in the region. 25. The Prime Ministers expressed their grave concern at the dire situation in Gaza and the tragic loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives following the brutal 7 October terrorist attacks by Hamas. They reaffirmed the urgent need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the safe, unconditional, and immediate release of all hostages and a rapid, massive and sustained increase in the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The Prime Ministers welcomed critical efforts by regional partners to achieve this as soon as possible and called on Israel to urgently facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. They reiterated that the protection of civilians in accordance with international law is of paramount importance, and expressed their deep concern at Israel\u2019s potential ground offensive into Rafah which would have catastrophic consequences for the civilian population sheltering there. The Prime Ministers restated their steadfast commitment to a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, which establishes a Palestinian state alongside Israel in peace and security. They called on the parties to urgently return to the negotiating table in an effort towards this \u2013 the best path for durable and lasting peace in the region. The Prime Ministers also shared the international community\u2019s grave concerns about broader regional escalation in the Middle East, particularly Iran\u2019s recent strikes on Israel, and urged maximum restraint on all sides. 26. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the third anniversary of the 1 February military coup in Myanmar and their deep concern for the deteriorating situation. They called on the Myanmar military authorities to immediately cease violence, release those arbitrarily detained, provide full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and create space for meaningful and inclusive dialogue between all parties in Myanmar. The Prime Ministers affirmed their strong support for the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus and encouraged the international community to work together in a pragmatic and constructive way to address the crisis and facilitate national reconciliation in Myanmar. 27. Both Prime Ministers underscored that New Zealand and Singapore are staunch supporters of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. They agreed that New Zealand and Singapore will continue to work together to strengthen their bilateral relationship and uphold international law and the multilateral system, and to stay in close contact on regional and global issues of concern. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the significant economic and climate change challenges facing SIDS and agreed to broaden and strengthen existing cooperation together advocating for small states both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, including through the Commonwealth.\nANNEX\nINITIATIVES FOR THE NEW \u2018SUPPLY CHAIN AND CONNECTIVITY\u2019 PILLAR UNDER THE SINGAPORE-NEW ZEALAND ENHANCED PARTNERSHIP"

Singapore is deeply concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. We support an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the swift and unhindered delivery of aid.

In 2022, Singapore established our Representative Office in Ramallah in 2022 to further facilitate our engagements with the PA.\nSingapore continues to believe that a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, is the only viable path to a comprehensive, just, and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\nI look forward to meeting you, and invite you to visit Singapore at a mutually convenient time. Until then, I wish you success in your new position.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Dr Mohammad Mustafa\nPrime Minister\nPalestinian Authority"

They welcomed efforts to make joint exercises more complex, and tasked officials to ensure defence and security remain a key pillar under the next phase of the CSP, including enhancing cooperation on defence science and technology in areas such as those under the Joint Strategic Statement of Intent on Science & Technology Collaboration.\nThe Leaders acknowledged Australia\u2019s continued support for the Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 (SAF) training in Australia and welcomed progress in implementing the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative, particularly plans to finalise the expansion of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in 2024. The Leaders also affirmed the progress on discussions to further expand training opportunities for the SAF in Australia.\nThe Leaders acknowledged Singapore\u2019s continued support for Australia\u2019s aircraft and ships in the region. The Leaders reaffirmed Australia\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s strong commitment to the Five Power Defence Arrangements, which remains an indispensable anchor for security in the region.\nThe Leaders welcomed Australia and Singapore\u2019s strong multilateral cooperation, through the United Nations and multilateral agencies.\nThe Leaders reaffirmed Australia and Singapore\u2019s unwavering commitment to strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as its cornerstone. They acknowledged the importance of upholding the independence and integrity of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as it fulfils its critical nuclear safeguards mandate in verifying States\u2019 nuclear non-proliferation obligations. The Leaders noted Australia\u2019s commitment to responsible nuclear stewardship and setting the highest non-proliferation standard in relation to its acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines under AUKUS. The Leaders acknowledged Singapore\u2019s offer to host Australia\u2019s conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines for port visits once ready.\nThe Leaders noted the global challenges posed by terrorism, foreign interference and disinformation, and reaffirmed the importance of deepening practical security cooperation to counter these threats, including through ongoing bilateral dialogue.

The Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to work together to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region. They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which promotes free trade and open markets and where differences are resolved peacefully in accordance with international law.\nThe Leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintain and promote security and stability in the South China Sea and underscored their strong support for freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded trade and emphasised the need for the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They emphasised the primacy of UNCLOS, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. They committed to working with partners to support States to uphold their established rights and obligations under UNCLOS. The Leaders noted work towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and emphasised the importance of the Code being consistent with international law, particularly UNCLOS, and not prejudicial to the legitimate rights of all States under UNCLOS.\nThe Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to uphold ASEAN Centrality and ASEAN-led regional architecture. They expressed their ongoing support for the practical implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, which articulates ASEAN\u2019s vision of an open, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture, and the ASEAN-Australia CSP. The Leaders agreed that through the ASEAN-Australia CSP, Australia would work with ASEAN to advance its integration efforts by strengthening cooperation on key and emerging areas such as the digital and green economies, and energy security.

They also called for the safe and unconditional release of all hostages. The Leaders affirmed that only a two-state solution, consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, will allow Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.\nThe Leaders unreservedly condemned the Houthis\u2019 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea which constitute a threat to navigational rights and freedoms, international commerce and maritime security. They expressed support for United Nations Security Council Resolution 2722 which, inter alia, demanded that the Houthis desist from such unlawful attacks.\nThe Leaders reiterated their strong condemnation of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in violation of international law, including the UN Charter. They continued to call for Russia\u2019s immediate withdrawal of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, as part of delivering a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible. In addition to the terrible damage and loss of life in Ukraine, the Leaders stressed the war is exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy, including heightening energy and food insecurity in the Indo-Pacific."

        "content": "Dawn Tan (CNA): The Israel-Hamas conflict featured very strongly in Parliament today. What would you say to those who perhaps are still unconvinced about Singapore\u2019s neutrality in this matter?\nMinister Vivian Balakrishnan: The first thing I would say is that the real question is not neutrality. The real question is, \u201cWhat is in Singapore\u2019s national interest?\u201d. We had an extensive discussion in Parliament today, and I would say the following.\nFirst, because we are at risk, we have to call out terrorism \u2013 wherever, whenever, whatever pretext, whatever justification, whatever circumstance \u2013 we have to call it out. And we did. What happened on 7 October 2023 was a blatant and flagrant act of terror. As I said, we called it out for our own sakes because we are at risk. Second, if Singapore was ever attacked, we too would assert the right of self defence. Therefore, when we said Israel has the right, it was also with a view on what we would do or have to do if we were ever faced with such a situation. Third point is, we also have been reminding everyone, and in particular the Israelis, that anyone who exercises that right of self defence has to comply with international law, the Geneva Convention, international humanitarian law. That is why today, I stated for the record that in our view, Israel\u2019s military response has now gone too far. These are statements that reflect Singapore\u2019s position and Singapore\u2019s national interest. It is not about neutrality or balance. It is about what is in our own interest.\nThe other very important dimension I was trying to put across today is that we are, by definition, multi-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious. Diversity is hard coded in our DNA. It is a design feature, it is a strength, but it is also a vulnerability. I was using our reactions to the conflict in Gaza as a worked example to tell all Singaporeans that there is going to be a wide diversity of views \u2013 some strongly held, some less so. The key challenge for us as Singaporeans is to respect each other, affirm and recognise that we can have such strongly held views, but do not import foreign quarrels and do not let that divide and polarise us.\nI was very cheered today that in Parliament, MPs, not just from the PAP (People\u2019s Action Party), but from the Workers\u2019 Party and including nominated MPs \u2013 we all arrived at a consensus. I hope that also will help engender a consensus in the larger Singapore community. Not an identity of views or perspectives, but that we can live with each other peacefully, and show the world how to live with such diversity. That will be Singapore's contribution to a world which has quite frankly become far more dangerous.\nOtelli Edwards (CNA): We have seen and we have reported tens of thousands of lives lost because of the conflict, and you have also announced a third tranche of aid. Can you just give us a bit more details if it is going to be similar to previous tranches?\nMinister: This time, we intend to work with our friends in Jordan. I just spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister yesterday. We are particularly focused on food and on medical supplies, because based on my interactions with him and the information we have been receiving, that is the critical need. We will make more announcements in the next couple of days but we do want to help. This expresses, again, the Singapore spirit at its best. Rather than just get angry, let us get active. Let us do something constructive and helpful. It also reflects that Singapore has excellent ties across the entire political spectrum in the Middle East. This again is a strength and it is a position of respect which we have not achieved by saying, \u201cYes sir, yes, sir, three bags full\u201d to everyone who wants us to agree with them on all counts. That is not the way we operate. But they know that we do careful calculations and assessments of our national interests and we do want to work with our partners overseas, but in a respectful, honest, and constructive way. I think this is the posture and the habit that we have to continue in Singapore.\nDawn Tan (CNA): Historically, Singapore has supported the Palestinians, for decades in a sense. You also mentioned the $10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance, Package. That was first put together in 2013, and sort of increased or enhanced in 2016. It is meant to go towards building a Palestinian state. Can you share with us, Dr Balakrishnan, how far that amount has been used and, in what way? I know there are courses and so on that have benefitted officials.\nMinister: Let us take a step back. Singapore believes the only way there is going to be lasting peace is if there are two states. Israel, entitled to live in peace and security, and the Palestinian people with a right to self-determination and their own state. But, and this is very big but \u2013 you are not going to achieve this until and unless there are direct, honest negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is not something you can impose from outside.\nSo, our position is that we are friends with both. We hope they will arrive at a formula. I do not know when that will be. In the meantime, we will be helpful, we will be constructive, we will be honest, and we have, I can honestly say, a good relationship with both sides. I have been to Israel twice and I have also been to Ramallah twice, and I say the same thing in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ramallah. Again, that is the secret for Singapore's foreign policy \u2013 that we are consistent, we are reliable, we are trustworthy. That gives us access and relevance. That gives us a role \u2013 not something to be taken for granted.\nOtelli Edwards (CNA): I believe there have been calls, some people calling for Singapore to sever ties with Israel, for instance. You have responded strongly to say that it is not constructive. It is not in Singapore's interest to do so. In a way, this whole Israel-Hamas issue has become a platform for us to talk about this openly and to show Singaporeans how diplomacy works.\nMinister: Yes, and I have explained this at length in Parliament and the Opposition agreed with us. We all arrived at consensus that we will not sever ties. In fact, that is not the way we conduct foreign policy. When you have a problem or a disagreement, all the more you need to maintain open channels of communication. Explain, try to make compromises if you can; try to arrive at a consensus if possible; and ultimately, make things better. On this question of discussions and interaction, I have always been a believer that you want to have respectful, rational, calm and deliberate discussions, which generate light and understanding and not generate heat. We have witnessed this in many other countries \u2013demonstrations and arguments which generate more heat than light, which generate more distrust than understanding and congruence in the center. This is our Singapore style. It does not mean we are shutting down views or that we do not recognise the diversity of views. I think it can be done in our Singapore way. We may not be perfect, but we will keep evolving and improving. It is possible to have these real conversations, but it has to be done in appropriate circumstances, in a constructive and respectful way. I was, frankly, very cheered by what happened in Parliament today because everyone said what they honestly believed, but we all converged in a Singaporean way.\nDawn Tan (CNA): Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, thank you very much for coming into the studio and sharing your thoughts with us on this."

        "content": "The following is a Joint Statement on the 6th United States-Singapore Strategic Partnership Dialogue, 27 February 2024, Singapore. Begin Text: 1. Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Albert Chua and United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink met in Singapore on 27 February 2024, to co-chair the 6th United States-Singapore Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Building on the enduring strength of the bilateral strategic partnership, the Dialogue reviewed ongoing areas of cooperation and discussed ways to further advance robust approaches to emerging challenges and mutually beneficial areas, such as in critical and emerging technologies (CET), energy, climate change, and regional capacity building.\n2. The co-chairs reaffirmed the strong defence and security partnership underpinned by the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding Regarding United States Use of Facilities in Singapore, the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security and accompanying 2005 Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), and the 2015 Enhanced DCA. Both sides benefit from U.S. forces\u2019 access to military facilities in Singapore, which supports the United States\u2019 presence in and engagement of the region, as well as from the United States\u2019 provision of overseas training and technology access to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Our two militaries also participate in overseas operations together, including during the SAF\u2019s ongoing deployment for Operation Prosperity Guardian under Combined Task Force 153: Red Sea Maritime Security. The co-chairs reiterated the governments\u2019 December 19 joint statement along with over 40 other partners condemning Houthi interference with navigational rights and freedoms in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula, particularly the Red Sea. The co-chairs welcomed the recent signing of the Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between the US Department of Defense and Singapore Ministry of Defence in December 2023 that would enable both sides to better address unanticipated supply chain disruptions that could affect defence needs. They also lauded the recently held 7th Law Enforcement and Homeland Security and Safety Cooperation Dialogue which focused on the growing threat of cybercrime and online scams as well as a wide range of law enforcement and homeland security issues. They noted the continued progress of the bilateral Cyber Dialogue, which was now in its third year. 3. The co-chairs welcomed the 20th Anniversary of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) this year. The USSFTA, which has been in force since 2004, is a linchpin in the bilateral economic relationship and testament to the strong economic and business ties between the two countries. The co-chairs also took stock of progress under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI), launched by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong in October 2021, and looked forward to further cooperation under this initiative. The PGI aims to strengthen trade and investment collaboration between the two economies in new and forward-looking areas, as reflected in joint statements released following the PGI annual dialogues in October 2022 and June 2023. In addition, the co-chairs noted the close cooperation between Singapore and the United States on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Both sides welcomed the significant outcomes announced to date, which will support the continued and constructive economic engagement among the United States, Singapore, and other IPEF partners in the region and provide a firm foundation to further deepen regional cooperation. They include the entry into force of the Supply Chain Agreement on 24 February 2024, and the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the Clean Economy and Fair Economy Agreements, as well as the Agreement on IPEF. Both sides looked forward to continuing to work closely together to implement these Agreements to deliver concrete benefits to all the IPEF partners. 4. The co-chairs discussed emerging areas of cooperation in areas such as CET, climate change, and energy. Both sides welcomed the launch of the inaugural U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue in October 2023 and looked forward to greater collaboration in artificial intelligence (AI), digital economy and data governance, biotechnology, critical infrastructure and technology supply chains, defence innovation, as well as quantum information science and technology. Both sides also discussed progress on the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership (USCP) which was launched in August 2021 and updated in June 2023. Notable progress has been made on regional energy transition, low- and zero-emission technologies and solutions, nature-based solutions and carbon markets workstreams and capacity building. On energy, the co-chairs underscored their support for ASEAN\u2019s clean energy transition and the realisation of the ASEAN Power Grid. The co-chairs also discussed partnership on civil nuclear energy cooperation to support Singapore\u2019s capability building in nuclear safety, security, nonproliferation, and understanding of advanced civil nuclear energy technologies, as part of Singapore\u2019s efforts to study all potential pathways for decarbonisation. 5. The co-chairs re-affirmed the close collaboration between Singapore and the United States in supporting capacity-building in Southeast Asia under the Singapore-U.S. Third Country Training Program (TCTP). Singapore and the United States have jointly organised 76 capacity building programmes for more than 2,000 officials from ASEAN Member States (AMS), Timor-Leste and the ASEAN Secretariat since the TCTP was established in February 2012. The co-chairs also welcomed the planned expansion of the scope of the TCTP to include the Pacific Islands region and looked forward to the pilot course in March 2024, which would include AMS, Timor-Leste, and members of the Pacific Islands Forum. Both sides expressed continued commitment to the TCTP and collaboration in new areas such as the Smart Cities Program on AI to deepen knowledge sharing in emerging areas. 6. The co-chairs exchanged views on regional and global developments and reiterated the commitment by the United States and Singapore to uphold the rules-based international order. Both sides reaffirmed the position that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and attempts to annex Ukrainian territory are violations of international law and the principles of the UN Charter. The co-chairs condemned the acts of violence and terrorism by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in Israel and reaffirmed Israel\u2019s right to self-defence in a manner that complied with international law, including international humanitarian law. Israel should do its utmost to ensure the safety and security of civilians, while Hamas must safely and immediately release all civilian hostages. The co-chairs expressed serious concern about the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and urged all parties to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies in a timely and sustainable manner. Both sides affirmed their shared view that the only viable path to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. 7. The co-chairs emphasised the importance of reinforcing an open, transparent, inclusive, and ASEAN-centric regional architecture. To this end, Singapore welcomed the commitment to ASEAN Centrality by the United States as seen from the upgrade of ASEAN-U.S. Relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2022 and the adoption of the ASEAN-U.S. Summit Leaders\u2019 Statement on Cooperation on the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) in September 2023 at the 11th ASEAN-U.S. Summit. The Statement reaffirms shared principles between the AOIP and the United States\u2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy, as well as ASEAN and the United States\u2019 commitment to tangibly support implementation of the four priority areas of the AOIP. Both sides also welcomed the Quad\u2019s support for ASEAN Centrality, including the Quad\u2019s agenda to support Indo-Pacific countries\u2019 priorities and needs, and explored synergies for mutually beneficial cooperation. 8. On Myanmar, the co-chairs reaffirmed ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus and reiterated their calls for the de-escalation of the situation, cessation of violence, and commencement of constructive dialogue among key stakeholders, as well as the need for access to humanitarian assistance. Both sides underscored the role of the United States and ASEAN\u2019s other external partners in working with ASEAN to address the crisis and facilitate national reconciliation in Myanmar. On the South China Sea (SCS), the co-chairs underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability, as well as the need to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight as provided under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Both sides reaffirmed that all concerned parties mustabide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterated support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE FEBRUARY 2024"

        "content": "Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO of FedEx,\nJonathan Kaplan, US Ambassador to Singapore,\nPng Cheong Boon, Chairman of EDB,\nDistinguished guests,\nLadies and gentlemen.\nIt is a pleasure to be here this morning to open FedEx\u2019s new Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa Headquarters right here in Singapore. Welcome back to Kawal Preet, who started your career with FedEx in Singapore \u2013 things come full circle.\nFedEx reached fifty years last year. One index of success is when your company\u2019s name becomes a verb. \u201cFedEx\u201d has become a verb. So, it is fifty years of success. What is heartening for us in Singapore is that for eighty per cent of that time, FedEx has been here in Singapore since 1984. You established what at that time was called the South Pacific regional headquarters, and that was done in 1992.\nOver the years, you have become a reliable, constant, and growing presence in this part of the world. Forty years on now, we are very pleased to see the deepening of this partnership which FedEx has had with Singapore. We view this as a vote of confidence in Singapore\u2019s position as a key global hub for trade, for logistics, and for connectivity.\nCurrently, FedEx employs about 1,200 people in Singapore. We hope that you will grow this sector. We believe this provides good jobs, jobs that will scale and levels of expertise that will rise in the future. This will be a great opportunity for FedEx as well as Singaporeans, the employees here and throughout this part of the world.\nToday, we are not only celebrating a milestone for FedEx but reaffirming the critical importance of enhancing global supply chains. The world, despite all the problems, is interconnected, at a very fundamental level. This is an existential need of the present and of the future.\nGlobalisation and modern supply chains have enabled globally dispersed economies to become increasingly interconnected. Not interconnected for its own sake, but interconnected in order to reap the full benefits of economies of scale and cost efficiencies.\nIf you look at a ubiquitous item, which everyone has in their pocket \u2013 a phone \u2013 it may well contain chips from the US, from South Korea, from Taiwan; batteries from China and South Korea; aluminium and rare earths from Australia and or even as far away as the Democratic Republic of Congo. All this is before the final package is usually assembled nowadays in China, India, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is these diverse, interconnected supply chains that really define the modern economy.\nWe do know that more recent geopolitical developments have led to significant shifts in global supply chains. Just think of the impact of the war in Ukraine and what that led to in terms of food and energy prices, and even in the reordering of those supply chains. More recently, the attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea have disrupted a critical sea lane of communication linking Europe and Asia, through which about twelve per cent of global trade by volume and thirty per cent of global container traffic passes. We are also painfully aware that geostrategic contestation between the world\u2019s two superpowers has also led to another layer of complexity for those of us in this line of business.\nOn top of that, the COVID-19 pandemic was another stark reminder that the paradigm of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d has also now been supplemented with \u201cjust-in-case\u201d. In fact, there is a premium on reliability, trustworthiness, speed, and the fact that you are good for your word. You see some of this also in this trend that some people have called \u2018reshoring\u2019 or \u2018onshoring\u2019 or \u2018friendshoring\u2019. But the fundamental strokes of this picture are very clear.\nIt means that companies everywhere will prioritise resilience and reliability in supply chain planning. It is not just about cost, not just even about speed. This is also an example where it had played to FedEx\u2019s strength. Because even fifty years ago, you were focused on higher value-added items; items for whom reliability of supply, timeliness of delivery mattered.\nIt is also worth pointing out that when FedEx established its presence here in Singapore forty years ago, the world looked quite different. Asia as a share of global GDP was much smaller. The other point for a network company like yours is also pre-positioning yourself for future growth. I think it is no accident that today we are inaugurating not just the Asia-Pacific, but India, South Asia, Africa, and Middle East. We all know this is where future growth is going to be multiplied. It is another example of you pre-positioning yourself for growth and to maximise the opportunities of the future.\nFrom a Singapore perspective, I just want to say we have always been a small, tiny city state. But unlike any other economy in the world, our trade volume is three times our GDP. You would be hard pressed to find any other country with that kind of ratio. What that means is that when we say we believe in free trade, we believe in supply chains. This is not just a standard stump speech that politicians make. This is lifeblood for this place, for this Little Red Dot called Singapore.\nThe ability for Singapore to play a crucial role for resilient supply chains has always been essential for our survival and success. We are a major global bunkering hub. We have significant share of refining in the petrochemical industry globally \u2013 all this despite Singapore not having a single drop of oil or molecule of natural gas. We are also a key global semiconductor industry node. We account for about five per cent of global wafer fab capacity, twenty per cent of global semiconductor equipment manufacturing output. It is not too bad for a place this small.\nToday, we are a global logistics and connectivity hub. Our port is one of the world\u2019s busiest. Our port handled a record 39 million shipping containers, or what we call twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) last year. A record for us. Changi Airport is also a significant global air cargo hub and one of the world\u2019s busiest international airports. It has one of the largest networks in the region, with connections to about 400 cities. We also ranked first on the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index in 2023.\nI should also add one other factoid, which is that even in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, even when passengers were not able to fly, we kept Changi Airport open. The airlines continued to fly. Sometimes, passenger seats were filled with cargo \u2013 air freight cargo of high value-added items. That commitment to remaining open, not panicking, and being reliable in the depths of the biggest crisis of recent times is another example of our commitment and why we believe we will continue to play a vital role in this global network.\nWe have been building up our connectivity ecosystem over the decades. We recognise and affirm that FedEx has been a key partner in this journey. You have certainly contributed to establishing and building Singapore\u2019s status as a key logistics hub. We are grateful for that partnership. You have been a reliable and like-minded partner during the COVID-19 pandemic. I referred to that earlier, and I think Kawal and Raj would have examples of where we played perhaps an understated but crucial role when the chips were down.\nIn this age of disruption, geopolitical contestation, and, as Jonathan has said, war and terrorism, we are not short of bad news and awful headlines. I put to you that just staying calm, cool, rational, reliable, focused on efficiency, focused on delivering what we have committed to our clients and customers, has become even more valuable. We are very glad, and I congratulate FedEx for opening your new headquarters here.\nAs Jonathan has also said, just as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) this year \u2013 a successful, ambitious, forward-leaning, ahead of its time free trade agreement which has withstood the test of time. It was the United States\u2019 first free trade agreement with an Asian country when it entered into force in 2004. It is a gold-standard FTA, and well worth celebrating.\nWe hope that companies like FedEx and indeed the wider business community will continue to take advantage of Singapore\u2019s position, Singapore\u2019s ability to serve as a vital global node in global supply chains, take advantage of the US-Singapore FTA, which enables American companies like FedEx to plug-and-play in our high trust, high reliability ecosystem, and use us as the springboard to tap into the wider Southeast Asian, South Asian, Middle East, African markets \u2013where growth is going be in the next two decades.\nSo, congratulations to the entire team that has made this possible and thank you for the privilege of joining you today."

They highlighted that the reform of global governance institutions is necessary to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in addressing global challenges. They also emphasised the importance of combating hunger and poverty, which is crucial to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAt the G20 FMM, Minister Maliki shared the views of other Foreign Ministers on the deeply distressing situation in Gaza and called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the safe, immediate, and unconditional release of all civilian hostages. He also underlined the role that Singapore has played in promoting global governance, through our establishment of the Forum of Small States and Global Governance Group, to give smaller countries a voice in multilateral processes. The full text of Minister Maliki\u2019s remarks are appended.\nOn the sidelines, Minister Maliki signed the Memorandum of Understanding on International Cooperation Development with Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina Diana Mondino, and met with the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and South Africa.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n23 FEBRUARY 2024\nMINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nDR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT THE 2024 RIO DE JANEIRO G20 FOREIGN MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nPLENARY SESSION ONE: THE G20\u2019S ROLE IN DEALING WITH THE ONGOING INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS\nThank you very much your Excellency Minister Vieira for inviting Singapore to this meeting.\n2 The current geopolitical landscape is very worrying, as articulated by many of our colleagues around the table.\n3 First, the situation in Gaza is distressing. Singapore supports an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to facilitate the urgent delivery of aid to affected civilians. We also call for the safe, immediate, and unconditional release of all civilian hostages.\n4 We are similarly troubled that tensions elsewhere in the Middle East have escalated. The Houthis\u2019 unlawful attacks on international merchant shipping in the Red Sea have disrupted a key sea line of communication, and impacted global trade and supply chains. Key sea lines of communications must remain open and secure.\n5 Second, in Europe, the strife between Russia and Ukraine remains at a stalemate. Russia\u2019s invasion has violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, including the territorial integrity of a sovereign country.\n6 Third, relations between major powers affect us all, both politically and economically. We should avoid bifurcation and a return to the Cold War where the world was split, with one pitted against the other.\n7 Comprising major players from all regions, the G20 under Brazil\u2019s leadership needs to demonstrate that it is able to work collectively to galvanise support and build consensus towards de-escalating tensions around the world.\n8 This includes urging all parties to refrain from taking actions that may have dire, unintended long-term consequences.\n9 Second, parties must be open to negotiations with support from the rest of the international community, especially those countries with the most influence.\n10 Third, such outcomes must be negotiated based on international law within the parameters of a rules-based multilateral system.\n11 The G20 under Brazil\u2019s Presidency has a full agenda, and will lay the groundwork for Brazil hosting of COP-30 next year. Singapore will do its part to contribute to the G20\u2019s important work, especially in assisting developing countries to achieve our sustainable development goals. G20 members have the special responsibility, both individually and collectively, to help bring about peace and security, for those goals to be achieved. Thank you.\nMINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nDR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT THE 2024 RIO DE JANEIRO G20 FOREIGN MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nPLENARY SESSION TWO: GLOBAL GOVERNANCE REFORM\nAmid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, the world requires even stronger multilateral cooperation than before. Having an open, inclusive, and rules-based international order is vital to tackling the many challenges facing us today.\n2 To ensure that global governance institutions remain relevant, the voices and concerns of smaller countries, in particular developing countries, must be taken into account. Singapore is the coordinator of three such groupings. The first is the Forum of Small States, which provides its 108 members with a platform to discuss issues of mutual concern. This helps small states contribute their views and inputs to international organisations such as the United Nations. The second grouping is the Global Governance Group, or 3G, which includes both small- and medium-sized countries from all regions, which seeks to play a similar role vis-\u00e0-vis the G20. In turn, the G20\u2019s engagement with the 3G provides for broader legitimacy and acceptance of the G20\u2019s decisions. More recently, we set up the cross-regional Small States Group to contribute to the UN\u2019s Summit of the Future.\n3 Mr. Chairman and Colleagues, the priorities laid out by the Brazilian G20 Presidency are fundamental.\n4 First, within and across countries, in particular developing and least developed countries, there remains a segment of our population which continues to struggle with hunger and poverty. The international community and the G20 can do more to encourage investments in education, investments in housing and healthcare, as well as in promoting jobs creation, all part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. This will increase the social mobility of populations so that the next generation will have a brighter future.\n5 Second, a key part of the Sustainable Development Goals involve dealing with climate change which affects all countries, regardless of size or geography. To transition away from fossil fuels as agreed by all Parties at the UNFCCC COP-28 in Dubai would require countries fulfilling their commitments towards climate finance, but also developing innovative financing solutions such as blended finance. To play our part, Singapore launched the Financing Asia\u2019s Transition Partnerships, or FAST-P, which seeks to mobilise up to US5 billion dollars from commercial and concessional capital. We will also continue to contribute to capacity building in developing countries, both bilaterally and in collaboration with third countries.\n6 Brazil can count on Singapore\u2019s contribution in the various G20 workstreams during its Presidency year. Thank you, Mr Chairman."

These centres enable rapid information-sharing and engagement with the commercial shipping community on maritime security incidents which allow timely and appropriate actions to be taken.\nOur agencies have been engaging operators of Singapore-registered ships to remind them to exercise vigilance, follow instructions from the local authorities and take necessary precautionary measures when transiting through the Red Sea region. We will continue to monitor the impact of such disruptions to global trade on our businesses. We stand ready to serve as a catch-up port to help diverted vessels from the Red Sea, and to work with our businesses to manage their supply chains and strengthen their contingency plans.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n6 FEBRUARY 2024"

        "date": "22 Jan 2024, 09:13",
        "country": "Uganda",
        "content": "Mr Chairman,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished colleagues,\nI warmly congratulate Uganda for hosting the Third South Summit, and for assuming the chairmanship of the G77&China. I am confident that under Uganda\u2019s chairmanship, we will be able to make significant strides towards building a stronger Global South.\nAs we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the G77&China this year, it is timely to reflect on the strong progress that developing countries have made in human capital development over the last few decades For example, the World Bank estimates that the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically from about 50% in the 1960s to about 8.8% in 2021.\nHowever, the road ahead has become more uncertain as the world faces a confluence of serious challenges. They include the lingering impact of the pandemic, greater economic volatility due to supply chain disruptions and inflation, as well as the existential challenge of climate change. According to the World Bank, developing countries are projected to grow just 3.9% in 2024, more than one percentage point below the previous decade\u2019s average. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these challenges, such as how small island developing countries are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events.\nThese challenges have also led to a significant rollback of hard-won development gains According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), last year, about 238 million people experienced food insecurity, an increase of about 21 million from the previous year. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report released by the UN Secretary-General in 2023 also showed that 30% of SDG targets are stagnating or declining.\nAs the largest grouping of developing countries at the UN, the G77&China has a unique role in contributing to solutions towards the array of development challenges that we face. We are in a position to amplify the voice of the South on these issues, and work with others within a rules-based multilateral framework to find collective solutions. In particular, we must continue our unwavering efforts towards the collective achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs remain the most critical pathway for ensuring the continued progress of developing countries. The G77&China should build on the SDG Political Declaration adopted at the SDG Summit in September last year. We should also seize opportunities to do more, including at the 4th International Conference on SIDS and the Summit of the Future this year, which will be crucial milestones to push forward the implementation of the SDGs.\nSingapore remains committed to working with fellow developing countries to achieve the G77&China\u2019s priorities, particularly in four key areas. First, we need to do more to address the pressing challenge of climate change. The decision by Parties at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems \u2013 in a just, orderly, and equitable manner \u2013 is a significant and positive development. This will come as a cost \u2013 felt more acutely by developing countries. Thus, more must be done to mobilise technology and finance in developing countries so that we may enable greater ambition while supporting sustainable development. While the developed countries must lead the way in this area, there is scope for greater South-South cooperation so that no one is left behind.\nSingapore will do our part to support fellow developing countries in ways that we can make a meaningful contribution. For example, atCOP28, Singapore announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate green transition in our region and beyond. This includes the Financing Asia\u2019s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) blended finance initiative, which aims to catalyse up to US$5 billion from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. Singapore also provides technical assistance and capacity-building courses through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen close to 150,000 participants from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the last three decades. Under this programme, we have also launched the Sustainability Action Package to give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda, and share best practices in climate adaptation and resilience.\nSecond, on trade, we welcome the G77&China\u2019s longstanding commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system. We also echo the G77&China\u2019s concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO.\nThird, on technology. We thank Cuba for making Technology a priority of its G77&China Chairmanship in 2023. Technological advancements offer immense opportunities for development and towards the achievement of the SDGs. However, serious and concerted efforts are required to harness the benefits of technology, including by working with global and community partners to bridge technological and digital divides, and promote greater inclusion and connectivity.\nLastly, transformation of global governance. Governments should work together to build a more inclusive global governance system, including through the reform of key global institutions, to better reflect current realities and respond to emerging challenges. The UN High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism had put forth several bold and ambitious proposals, including on repurposing of the multilateral development bank system. We are pleased that some of these proposals have been incorporated in the G77&China\u2019s input to the Pact of the Future. Singapore will continue to work closely with G77&China to ensure that the Summit of the Future will deliver outcomes that benefit all, including developing countries.\nIn closing, let me reaffirm Singapore\u2019s steadfast commitment to working with fellow developing countries, to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards a better tomorrow. Thank you.\nPhoto Caption: Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman at the Third South Summit, Kampala, Uganda, 21 January 2024\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

During their meeting, they noted the steady cadence of high-level visits on both sides. In 2022, Singapore\u2019s total trade in goods with Portugal amounted to S$1.6 billion, a 71.6% increase from 2021. Both Ministers agreed to build on the momentum of bilateral and economic ties and deepen cooperation in emerging areas including in innovation and renewable energy.\nThey also welcomed more business and people-to-people exchanges between Singapore, Portugal and our respective regions. Companies in Portugal can leverage on the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement to use Singapore as a gateway to tap into the vast economic potential of Southeast Asia. PSA has been investing in the port of Sines since 2000 and commenced an expansion of its operations worth over \u20ac300 million in 2022. Portugal\u2019s largest utility company, Energias de Portugal (EDP), has committed over S$2 billion over the next four years to accelerate green energy transition in Southeast Asia.\nFollowing their meeting, Minister Balakrishnan and Minister Cravinho inaugurated the launch of the Singapore-Portugal Innovation Alliance (SPIA). The SPIA will foster collaboration among startups and technology companies, facilitate greater business networks, and catalyse market entries into Portugal, Singapore, and our respective regions. Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s remarks at the SPIA launch are appended\nMinister Balakrishnan also met Mayor of Lisbon Carlos Moedas on 4 January 2024. They exchanged views on Lisbon\u2019s potential as a hub for startups, and agreed to step up exchanges in innovation, housing and public service.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n6 JANUARY 2024\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S REMARKS AT THE INAUGURATION OF THE SINGAPORE-PORTUGAL INNOVATION ALLIANCE\nAT THE NOVA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, LISBON, 5 JANUARY 2024\nYour Excellency Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal\nMr Pedro Oliveira, Dean of the Nova School of Business and Economics\nMs Alexandra Ventura, Executive Director of the Westmont Institute of Tourism and Hospitality\nMs Jacinthe Tay, President of the Board of Directors of the Singapore-Portugal Innovation Alliance\nLadies and Gentlemen\nThis is a beautiful campus. I can understand why we have so many students from all over the world, including Singapore here.\nIt is a pleasure to be here this afternoon with my good friend Jo\u00e3o (Gomes Cravinho) to officiate the inauguration of the Singapore-Portugal Innovation Alliance. As the name suggests, the Alliance has a special emphasis on developing the growth of innovation-driven entities, especially startups and tech companies. Its purpose is to bring together tech innovation companies and stakeholders in the larger ecosystem to foster market entries into Portugal and Singapore, and our respective regions of the world.\nIt is fitting that we are launching it here in Lisbon, a city that has just been named the European Capital of Innovation last month by the European Commission. We congratulate Lisbon and Portugal for that. If you look around, you can understand why Lisbon is a shining example of how cities can harness innovation and reshape the urban landscape, but more important than that, reshape mental landscapes and perceptions of opportunities for the future. The annual Web Summit held in Lisbon is an iconic event that attracts over 70,000 participants, including leaders and experts in a variety of fields.\nLike Portugal, Singapore aims to do more in innovation and entrepreneurship. Through the years, we have established a reputation as one of the leading startup hubs in Asia and indeed, in the world. In 2023, Singapore was ranked 8th in the Global Startup Ecosystem Report. We are committed to building Singapore as a Global Asia Node of innovation, technology, and enterprise. For example, through our Global Innovation Alliance, we help startups and SMEs gain access to overseas partners, ideas, technology and skills. This is needed if our startups are going to be able to grow and become world leading as quickly as possible. Domestically, those of you who have been to Singapore would be familiar with incubators and platforms like BLOCK71 and Startup SG, and the nurture we provide for our startup ecosystem at home.\nI am very happy to see the creation of this Alliance. I am even happier this is not something that originated from the government but is a ground-up effort driven by Singaporeans living in Portugal in partnership with collaborators and other stakeholders in Portugal itself. I would like to give special thanks to Jacinthe Tay for her hard work in rallying everyone together for this Alliance. Starting initiatives like this is not easy. Sometimes, it is even harder than a startup as you do not have immediate profit motives or awards for people to sign on. I appreciate how difficult it is. The fact that you have been able to corral a group of merry men and women to join you speaks well for the spirit of enterprise, entrepreneurship, and verve that I hope Singaporeans all over the world will emulate.\nThere remains great potential for synergy between Singapore and Portugal. We are both small nations, outward oriented, maritime seafaring nations - that confluence of outlook makes us natural partners. The world stands at the threshold of a new revolution involving digital technologies like AI, quantum computing, synthetic biology, and renewable energy to deal with the challenges of climate change. Because we are at an inflection point, this is a moment more than ever before when we need startups and the spirit of innovation and enterprise. Congratulations, and I wish you all the very best.\nCaption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho in Lisbon, 5 January 2024\nCredit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nCaption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan inaugurating the launch of the Singapore-Portugal Innovation Alliance with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho at the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon, 5 January 2024\nCredit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nCaption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Mayor of Lisbon Carlos Moedas, 4 January 2024\nCredit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

We express our deepest condolences to the families of the 135 UNRWA staff who have lost their lives.\nThe Singapore Government and the Singapore Red Cross have worked closely with the Egyptian Government and the Egyptian Red Crescent to provide humanitarian supplies to Gaza. We will continue to work closely with our friends and partners to support these humanitarian relief efforts.\nMr President\nWe are meeting today because the humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated significantly with over 18,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and up to 1.9 million people reportedly displaced, which represents about 85 percent of the population in Gaza. The Commissioner General of UNRWA sent a letter to the President of the General Assembly on 7 December 2023 warning of an \u201cirreversible disaster\u201d. He also said that the humanitarian situation in Gaza \u201cis now untenable\u201d, with people \u201cdesperate, hungry and terrified\u201d. We were therefore disappointed that the Security Council was not able to adopt the draft humanitarian resolution put forward by the United Arab Emirates last week, which Singapore had co-sponsored.\nMr President,\nSingapore also co-sponsored the ESS resolution entitled \u201cProtection of Civilians and Upholding Legal and Humanitarian Obligations\u201d that the General Assembly adopted with an overwhelming majority of 153 votes in favour on 12 December.\nSingapore supports the call made in this resolution for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; this is essential for the urgent and unhindered provision of humanitarian aid to civilians throughout Gaza. I wish to reiterate Singapore\u2019s grave concern at the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza which has led to the loss of many thousands of innocent civilian lives.\nSingapore also supports the call made in the resolution for all parties to comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians. We recognise that Israel has the right to defend its citizens and territory. But in exercising this right, Israel must comply fully with international humanitarian law. This means responding in a proportionate manner, this means avoiding the indiscriminate killing of civilians, and this means avoiding the collective punishment or permanent mass displacement of civilians.\nSingapore strongly supports the call made in the resolution for the immediate release of all remaining hostages. The taking of hostages is prohibited by international law. Hamas and other parties involved must ensure the safety and security of the hostages and facilitate their immediate release.\nMr President,\nIt is a fact that the heinous terrorist attack carried out by Hamas in Israel on 7 October led to the killing of over 1,200 Israelis, the majority of whom were innocent civilians. We regret that the resolution adopted on 12 December does not condemn or even make reference to the actions of Hamas. Singapore wishes to place on record our view that terrorist attacks carried out by any party cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale.\nSingapore continues to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just, and comprehensive solution to this crisis is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. We support the right of Israelis and Palestinians to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security, and dignity. We call on leaders from both sides to show leadership, exercise restraint and take the difficult but necessary steps towards a two-state solution.\nThank you."

SM (then DPM) Teo Chee Hean used to lead the Singapore delegation for the YLP. In fact, I was part of the very first YLP, as the then-Acting Minister (CCY).\nb. A decade later, I am glad to lead the Singapore delegation for this year\u2019s YLP. I have invited SM Teo to join us, to provide continuity. I have also brought younger colleagues from Singapore to be part of the delegation, so we can continue to build close personal ties between the leadership teams of our two countries.\nc. I thank my co-chair HRH Crown Prince Billah, and all our Bruneian friends, especially Pehin Halbi Yussof and Dato Amin Liew, for their warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the visit. You have given us a very good programme, a chance to have social interaction with our counterparts \u2013 we had a bowling game yesterday; we had an audience with His Majesty, a luncheon with his Royal Highness the Crown Prince; we had the chance to meet many people. We really appreciate all that you have put together, including the many meals you have hosted us to. Thank you very much.\nThe special relationship between Brunei and Singapore was built decades ago by the late Seri Begawan and Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\na. Theirs was a friendship forged by the profound shared experiences of their time.\nb. The steps each side took towards independence for our countries.\nc. The shared belief that our hard-won independence and sovereignty could only be sustained through determination and grit, and by working with like-minded countries like each other.\nEver since, our bilateral relations have grown from strength to strength, especially since we have so much in common.\na. Brunei and Singapore are the two smallest countries in ASEAN.\nb. We are both heavily dependent on external trade.\nc. We both place a high premium on a stable and rules-based international order, because that is the basis for our prosperity and growth.\nd. That\u2019s why there\u2019s such a strong and natural affinity between our two countries. This has enabled our friendship to endure through the decades, and helped us flourish as two sovereign nations.\nA Dangerous and Fragmented World\nNext year, we mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries. It is an opportunity to celebrate our many achievements, to renew our bonds of friendship, and to chart the next bound of our special relationship.\nIt is timely for us to do so because we are entering a different world \u2013 one which is more dangerous and fragmented, and less hospitable to small states like ours.\na. We can see troubling developments all around us.\nb. In Europe, the war in Ukraine has been raging on for nearly 2 years, with no resolution in sight.\nc. In the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Hamas is entering its third month, and is causing immense suffering for the people of Gaza. The violence also threatens to escalate into a wider conflict in the region.\nd. Here in Asia, we are fortunate to have enjoyed peace for more than 50 years since the end of the Vietnam war. But things can easily go wrong. Although both superpowers, China and the US, do not want a conflict, there are tensions and risks in this part of the world, because of the cross-strait situation, as well as rival claims in the South China Sea. Accidents and miscalculations can easily happen.\nThese geopolitical uncertainties are also weighing on the global economy.\na. In the past, free trade was actively promoted around the world, as part of win-win cooperation, and for global shared prosperity.\nb. Now, trade is shaped not just by economic logic, but also by geopolitical alignment and national security. The major powers are taking active steps to rebuild their industrial capacity and shore up their own security. Countries are near-shoring and friend-shoring to build more resilient supply chains. Companies are adding in more redundancy and taking steps to reduce disruption risks. We are operating in a very different global economy from the past few decades.\nMeanwhile, climate change continues to loom large. Countries around the world have taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But these steps still fall far short of what would be necessary to stabilise the climate at between 1.5~2degrees of warming. That is the threshold beyond which many scientists expect to see irreversible tipping points in terms of global warming. In fact, we are already experiencing more frequent extreme weather events. If we continue on the current trajectory, we are likely to see more weather changes as well as an escalating environmental and climate disaster. We hope it is not too late to prevent this from happening. But we have to be prepared for worst case scenarios, including the impact of rising sea levels on our low-lying coastal areas.\nIn short, the world has become more fragmented and volatile, more dangerous \u2013 with more tail risks which can create significant uncertainties for all of us.\nStrengthening our Partnership\nAs small states, both Brunei and Singapore have to adapt to the world as it is, and not as we would like it to be. But we are far from powerless. Being small allows us to stay nimble and move quickly. We survive and thrive through our own wit and ingenuity. Importantly, we work with like-minded partners to advance our shared interests. For example, consider how four small countries, Brunei, Singapore, Chile and New Zealand or the P4, came together for a free trade agreement years ago. This set the stage for a much more ambitious Pacific Rim agreement, which became the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and later the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), now one of the world\u2019s largest free trade areas.\nSo small states have agency; we can make things happen despite our small size. That is why, in this big, dangerous world, it is essential for Singapore and Brunei to band together. As close friends, we must work together to manage risks proactively, and position ourselves well for the future.\nFortunately, we have built up a deep collaboration across a wide range of areas over the decades. This forms a very strong foundation for us to build upon.\nOne good example is defence cooperation, which is a key pillar of our relationship. We established our longstanding defence relations in 1976, well before formal diplomatic ties were established when Brunei became independent in 1984. At that time, with the British scaling down their presence in Singapore and the region more generally, Singapore was rapidly developing our own military capabilities. Brunei was also keen to build up its own defence capabilities. So, we became natural partners in the security domain.\nSince then, our military-to-military interactions have deepened in scope and complexity.\na. Today, we have regular exercises between all three services of our armed forces. Last year, our armies celebrated the 25th anniversary of Exercise Maju Bersama.\nb. This morning, I had the honour of attending the commissioning ceremony of a Patrol Vessel, the KDB AL-FARUQ, together with His Royal Highness Crown Prince Billah. This is the second Patrol Vessel which the Republic of Singapore Navy has transferred to the Royal Brunei Navy. It will further expand opportunities for cooperation in maritime security as well as naval training, engineering and logistics.\nc. Meanwhile, Singapore will always be appreciative of Brunei\u2019s steadfast support for the SAF\u2019s training at Temburong. Generations of Singaporean soldiers, including myself \u2013 in fact all the males in my delegation \u2013 have trained in the jungles of Temburong. Once you have trained there, you will never forget the experience; it stays with you all your life. We have fond, lasting memories of our time training in Temburong, and I am sure subsequent generations of Singaporeans training there will likewise have similar memories.\nd. These interactions help enhance the professionalism of our two armed forces. More importantly, they also build trust and forge deep ties of friendship among our peoples.\nAnother longstanding example of our partnership is the Currency Interchangeability Agreement\na. It is a very unique arrangement between our two countries, and it has withstood the test of time \u2013 surviving major economic disruptions, such as the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.\nb. This policy of freely convertible currencies has benefited both our economies and peoples. It has eliminated foreign exchange rate risks and minimised transaction costs. It has facilitated the growth of trade and investments between our two countries.\nBeyond these two pillars, Singapore and Brunei collaborate across a whole range of areas, in health, education, culture, foreign affairs, just to name a few. We saw this clearly during the Covid-19 pandemic over the last three years. Ministers from both sides regularly engaged one another throughout the pandemic, including over text and Whatsapp messages, to share information on the latest best practices to respond to the virus, and explore ways to support each other through that difficult time.\na. We ensured that trade, especially of medically critical products, continued to flow unimpeded between our two countries.\nb. We helped each other optimise our respective Covid-19 vaccination schedules, by coordinating a mutually beneficial vaccine-swap of Moderna vaccines.\nc. When Singapore decided to open up our borders and allow fully vaccinated travellers to enter Singapore without quarantine (i.e., Vaccinated Travel Lanes), Brunei was one of the first countries we opened up to.\nAll these reflect the very close ties between our two countries. And last year, during His Majesty\u2019s State Visit to Singapore, our bilateral relations took another step forward when we agreed to cooperate in several new areas of mutual interest.\nI am therefore confident that we can build on these very strong foundations to advance our shared interests, build even closer bonds, and forge a partnership that endures for all seasons. Let me suggest four broad areas where we can further strengthen our cooperation.\nFirst, there is potential for closer ties to make our countries more resilient. Food security is one area where we are natural partners. Brunei has abundant land and natural resources, while Singapore imports almost all of our food. We already import seafood products from Brunei. Recently, we also accredited Brunei as a new source for eggs. There is scope to do more, including in areas like processed beef, poultry (or chicken), as well as agri-tech R&D. Such cooperation will bring about mutual benefits for both sides. It can enable Brunei to diversify its economy as part of its Brunei Vision 2035, and at the same time, provide Singapore with an additional reliable source of food imports.\nBeyond food, we can also explore other areas of resilience. In particular, we can work together to strengthen our preparedness for future disease outbreaks and pandemic threats. We can be sure there will be yet another disease outbreak in the future, and future pandemics to deal with. We can also improve our medical supply resilience, such as by facilitating the movement of medical products during times of emergency and crisis.\nSecond, there is much we can do to support each other\u2019s green transition. Both our countries seek to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Achieving this goal will not be easy. It will require a massive restructuring and transformation of our economies towards more low-carbon activities. We therefore have a shared interest in working together and exchanging best practices. In particular, Brunei has the potential to scale up deployment of renewable energy, especially solar. Singapore is looking to import renewable energy as well as green hydrogen. Both countries are also exploring solutions like carbon capture and storage, as well as carbon markets. There is therefore a lot for both sides to gain by stepping up cooperation in these areas.\nThird, as small countries, we should work together at regional and global fora to amplify our voices on the international stage. We have always collaborated closely in ASEAN. We should continue to push for greater ASEAN integration. One way is deepening digital connectivity in Southeast Asia, by advancing the ASEAN Digital Framework Agreement or DEFA. We can also benefit from better infrastructure linkages in the region, for example, in transport and power grid connections. A strong and united ASEAN will give us the best chance to secure continued peace, stability and prosperity for all of us and for the region.\nGlobally, our shared strategic outlook also makes our two countries natural partners at many international platforms. We should work together to sustain and strengthen the rules-based international order. At the WTO, we can help to advance the discussions around outstanding issues like dispute settlement, shape the agenda for WTO reform, and strengthen the global consensus on free trade. We can also find ways to update multilateral institutions like the IMF and the World Bank, so that they are better equipped to deal with the global challenges of our time.\nFourth, we must continue to engender more frequent and closer interaction with each other, and strengthen our people-to-people ties, because these people linkages are the foundation of our special relationship.\na. We are doing this at the leadership level, and as I mentioned earlier, this started with the friendship between the late Seri Begawan and Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The friendships and frequent interactions have continued with His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and successive PMs of Singapore \u2013 from Mr Goh Chok Tong to now Mr Lee Hsien Loong. And I assure you that it will continue under my watch.\nb. Over the past few days, I\u2019ve had good meetings with His Majesty the Sultan, as well as High Royal Highness Crown Prince Billah. My colleagues in the delegation have also had the chance to get to know their counterparts better. Everyone in the leadership team in Singapore are fully invested in growing the special relationship with Brunei.\nApart from this, we should intensify exchanges between our two civil services, to share best practices and bring them closer together. Today, we conduct many exchanges and training with each other \u2013 I am sure many of the Bruneian officials in this room have either participated in the various programmes held in Singapore, or hosted visiting Singaporean counterparts here in Brunei. In fact, we have with us today 10 participants of the Brunei-Singapore Defence Scholars\u2019 Interaction Programme, an exchange programme jointly organised by MINDEF-Singapore and MINDEF-Brunei to build ties between the future leaders of our armed forces. They have spent the past three days in Brunei meeting senior defence leaders from both sides, and learning about our common security challenges.\nRecently, we took another step to deepen our civil service exchanges, with eight Bruneian civil servants starting yearlong attachments with Singapore government agencies. These are important initiatives that we want to continue to enhance as much as possible.\nWe should also broaden and strengthen exchanges amongst our youths. Many of us in this room would probably appreciate and understand the importance of the special relationship between our two countries. But younger Bruneians and Singaporeans may be less familiar with our historical circumstances, the its strategic imperatives of our two countries coming together, or they may even take the special bond we share for granted.\na. We should therefore make an extra effort to encourage more exchanges between our youths, and to nurture youth leaders on both sides so that they will have a broad understanding of our history, culture as well as strategic imperatives and perspectives.\nb. We are bringing our students together through the Brunei Darussalam-Singapore Youth Education Scholarship, and will soon welcome a second batch of students in Singapore this month. For our young adults, we have the Singapore-Brunei Youth Leaders Exchange Programme, which we take turns to host, and Singapore is happy to host next year. These are all important platforms which we must continue to develop and grow.\nConclusion\nAs small states, Singapore and Brunei will always share similar interests and concerns. In a world increasingly beset by turbulence and volatility, both of us have stood as bastions of peace and stability. Working hand in hand, we have defied the odds of history to succeed. We have built a deep reservoir of mutual trust and respect for each other.\nThe 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year is an occasion for us to celebration. But we should not just look back and take stock of what we have achieved. We must also look forward \u2013 to set new and more ambitious targets for cooperation, and to renew and strengthen our partnership for the next bound.\nTogether, we can navigate the challenges ahead, and create many more opportunities for shared growth and prosperity. Together, we can take the special Singapore-Brunei relationship to even greater heights and ensure our partnership endures for all seasons.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong witnessed the commissioning ceremony for the Patrol Vessel KDB AL-FARUQ, officiated by His Royal Highness Crown Prince and Senior Minister at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, 13 December 2023.

        "content": "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan have written to Mrs Nancy Kissinger to convey condolences on the passing of former US Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger. The text of the letters is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n1 DECEMBER 2023\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Mrs Nancy Kissinger\n30 November 2023\nDear Nancy,\nHo Ching and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your beloved husband, Dr Henry Kissinger.\nDr Kissinger will be remembered warmly by many around the world. He was a peerless diplomat, true statesman, and visionary of his time. As a leader, he served with conviction and pragmatism. He was convinced the United States had a vital responsibility to maintain global peace and stability, and acted on this conviction.\nDr Kissinger was deeply involved in President Nixon\u2019s rapprochement with China in 1972. This watershed moment transformed the geostrategic order. It led to an extended period of stable U.S.-China relations, steady global growth and deepening globalisation that lasted for decades, greatly benefitting the U.S. and many other countries.\nFrom Singapore\u2019s perspective, another of Dr Kissinger\u2019s major accomplishments was the extraction of the U.S. from the Vietnam War. He felt deeply the need to protect U.S. credibility and its global influence, and refused to simply abandon America\u2019s South Vietnamese ally. Though he was bitterly criticised for his actions, his strategy bought the non-Communist countries of Southeast Asia precious time. We were able to build up our political, economic, and military strength, and to organise ourselves into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By the time South Vietnam fell in 1975, and the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978, the ASEAN members were much better able to deal with the security threats.\nMy father always spoke of Dr Kissinger with the greatest respect and warmth. Their friendship lasted for nearly half a century. I was deeply touched that Dr Kissinger travelled all the way to Singapore in March 2015 to attend my father\u2019s State Funeral, as well as by the moving eulogy that he delivered, extempore, at the private memorial service for Mr Lee in New York that September.\nI had the privilege of knowing Dr Kissinger personally too. Ho Ching and I recall fondly staying with you and Henry at your home in Kent, Connecticut in 2007. I have benefitted greatly from Henry\u2019s counsel, wisdom, and curiosity about the world. He had a constant hunger for knowledge, a drive to understand the transformative forces that are changing the geopolitics of the world, including new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.\nWe last met when I visited New York in April 2022. Our conversation lasted well over an hour. Henry was in fine form. He asked many probing questions, and was completely au fait with the latest international developments. Even in his last few months, he continued to offer insightful perspectives and wise counsel, particularly on U.S.-China relations.\nDr Kissinger touched many hearts throughout his long life. His legacy will remain with us for a long time to come. His was a life well lived, and it has been my honour and good fortune to have known him.\nPlease accept our deepest condolences during this time of grief.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nLetter from Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan to Mrs Nancy Kissinger\n1 December 2023\nDear Mrs Kissinger,\nI am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your husband, Dr Henry Kissinger.\nDr Kissinger was an intellectual giant whose tireless diplomatic efforts helped to reshape the world. He was the architect behind many policies that indelibly changed the global order, including the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China as well as the extrication of the United States from the Vietnam War. These have allowed countries the time and space to develop and prosper, and proved that open economies, globalisation, and economic integration can uplift societies.\nFor Singapore, Dr Kissinger was a longstanding friend and ardent supporter over the decades, stemming from his friendship with our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore has benefitted from Dr Kissinger\u2019s conviction in the need for a strong American presence in Southeast Asia, which translated into stability and prosperity for the region.\nI had the privilege of meeting Dr Kissinger several times over the years. My conversations with him have always been the highlights of my visits to New York City. He never shied away from new challenges, and our conversations delved into pressing questions of the day such as artificial intelligence, nuclear non-proliferation, and climate change, to try and ensure the safety and well-being of humanity. Our meetings were precious opportunities for me to exchange insights on geopolitics and tap his wisdom when tackling thorny quandaries in foreign policy. Dr Kissinger was, and will continue to be an inspiration and mentor for many of us.\nPlease accept my heartfelt condolences. I wish you and your family strength in your bereavement.\nYours sincerely,\nDR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN"

        "content": "Singaporeans have contributed a total of more than S$7 million in cash and in-kind donations to support relief efforts in Gaza. Singaporeans feel deep compassion for victims of the war and have responded with heartfelt generosity. In view of the urgent need for aid, the Singapore Government has deployed a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aircraft to deliver life-saving supplies for civilians in Gaza, while humanitarian supply lines remain open. An RSAF Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) conveying humanitarian assistance departed from Changi Air Base (East) for Egypt in the early hours of 30 November 2023.\nThis package comprises medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, blankets, sanitation items, water filters and food from the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) including the Singapore Red Cross, Mercy Relief, and Relief Singapore. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had engaged the Egyptian Red Crescent to determine which supplies were most needed. The SAF\u2019s Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) led efforts to coordinate and consolidate aid from participating agencies. This package is Singapore\u2019s second tranche of humanitarian assistance for Gaza.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Defence Mr Zaqy Mohamad were at Changi Air Base (East) to send off the RSAF crew, along with the Egyptian Ambassador-designate to Singapore Ahmed Mostafa Abdelaal Mohamed, Singapore\u2019s Representative to the Palestinian Authority Hawazi Daipi and representatives from participating NGOs. Singapore\u2019s Ambassador to Egypt Dominic Goh will witness the handover of the humanitarian package to the Egyptian Red Crescent upon arrival in Egypt.\nMinister Balakrishnan said: \u201cSingaporeans are deeply concerned for the civilians in Gaza who are facing a severe humanitarian crisis due to the war. We are grateful for the generous outpouring of support and fund raising by the Singapore Red Cross, the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, Mercy Relief, Relief Singapore and many other Singapore NGOs. The SAF is launching this special flight to deliver urgently needed medical and humanitarian supplies. We also extend our gratitude to the Government of Egypt and the Egyptian Red Crescent for their crucial support in facilitating the delivery of these essential supplies to the civilians in Gaza.\u201d\nSMS Zaqy said: \u201cWe are here to provide assistance through the RHCC and the RSAF to provide support to deliver the humanitarian aid package from here to Egypt, working together with partners such as the MFA, the MOH and our NGOs such as Singapore Red Cross, Mercy Relief and Relief Singapore. This is a testament of our strong linkages and our close collaboration between the NGOs and the Singapore Government\u2026 From there we will hand it over to the Egyptian Red Crescent who will deliver it to those in need in Gaza. I thank the RSAF servicemen and women who are providing support for this mission. I hope that they remain vigilant throughout the mission and we want them to come home safe and secure to their families and loved ones. I wish them all the best and mission success.\u201d\nThe Singapore Red Cross\u2019 (SRC) Head of Global Engagement, Ms Rebekah Lim, said: \u201cThe Singapore Red Cross has been working closely with the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SAF\u2019s Changi RHCC, the Egyptian Red Crescent and other humanitarian organisations to deliver relief assistance into Gaza. Besides sending relief supplies such as hygiene kits, food parcels and medical items in our initial tranches of support, I am glad that SRC is now able to deploy water filters through the humanitarian flight to Egypt coordinated by RHCC. We believe that these water filters will be very useful in providing clean drinking water for the civilians in Gaza, making most of the limited water supplies available. The situation on the ground is complex. It is only through the strong collaboration with the authorities and our humanitarian partners like ERC, that we are able to channel more humanitarian assistance to those in need within Gaza.\"\nSingapore will continue to work closely with our humanitarian partners to offer additional assistance and support to the affected communities. We urge all parties to allow the immediate, safe, and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to affected civilians throughout Gaza.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF DEFENCE\nSINGAPORE\n30 NOVEMBER 2023\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Senior Minister of State for Defence Mr Zaqy Mohamad sent off the RSAF mission crew at Changi Air Base (East).\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and SMS Zaqy Mohamad, along with Egyptian Ambassador-designate to Singapore Ahmad Mostafa Abdelaal Mohamed, Singapore\u2019s Representative to the Palestinian Authority Hawazi Daipi, senior Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Officers, and representatives from participating NGOs were present at Changi Air Base (East) to send off the RSAF mission crew.\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Defence\nTRANSCRIPT OF REMARKS BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT THE SEND-OFF OF SINGAPORE\u2019S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR GAZA, CHANGI AIR BASE (EAST)\nMinister: Thank you all for being here late at night.\nOver the last two months, Singaporeans have been deeply concerned with the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza as a result of the war. Singaporeans have been very generous. More than S$7 million has been raised, both in terms of funds as well as in-kind (donations). The first tranche of assistance was delivered earlier this month when Minister Maliki (Osman) went to Cairo, and the Singapore Red Cross handed over supplies, as well as funds that were raised by the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, to the Egyptian Red Crescent.\nThis is the second tranche. The reason why there has been some urgency is because this is now day six of the humanitarian truce. We are all hoping that the truce will be extended, but we also know that the situation is dire and there is an urgent need for the assistance to be delivered as soon as possible. We are very grateful that the RSAF (Republic of Singapore Air Force) has enabled us to deliver this essential medical and humanitarian assistance quickly in this very narrow window. Without the assistance and support of the RSAF, this would not be possible. The contents of the package include medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, blankets, sanitation, water filters \u2013 the essentials of life.\nWe were very careful when we were arranging these to work with the Egyptian Red Crescent to make sure that these are supplies which are needed, relevant and directly helpful. On this note, again, I need to also express our appreciation to the Ministry of Health, Singapore Red Cross, Mercy Relief, and to Relief Singapore for coming forward and helping to assemble these essential life-saving equipment and supplies. The supplies will be handed over to the Egyptian Red Crescent, who will then be responsible for physically transporting the supplies across into Gaza through the Rafah crossing.\nWe send this as an expression of Singaporeans\u2019 support, Singaporeans\u2019 compassion for the innocent victims of this war. We also hope that the humanitarian truce will be extended, and ultimately, what we all hope for is that peace will prevail and that innocent lives will be protected. We will watch very closely how the situation evolves. But again, we are grateful to the RSAF, to all the NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations) in Singapore, and to the generous donors in Singapore. We send these tokens of our support, our care, our concern, and our compassion to our fellow human beings in Gaza.\nREMARKS BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE MR ZAQY MOHAMAD AT THE SEND-OFF OF SINGAPORE\u2019S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR GAZA\nSMS: MINDEF is closely monitoring the situation in Gaza and we are deeply concerned with the humanitarian situation, particularly for civilians affected by the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is providing strong support for Singapore\u2019s humanitarian aid to Gaza. We are here to provide assistance through the Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre (RHCC) and the RSAF to provide support to deliver the humanitarian aid package from here to Egypt, working together with partners such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health and our Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Singapore Red Cross, Mercy Relief and Relief Singapore. This is a testament of our strong linkages and our close collaboration between the NGOs and the Singapore government. The RSAF is committing the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport flight to deliver the package to Egypt. From there we will hand it over to the Egyptian Red Crescent who will deliver it to those in need in Gaza. I thank the RSAF servicemen and women who are providing support for this mission. I hope that they remain vigilant throughout the mission and we want them to come home safe and secure to their families and loved ones. I wish them all the best and mission success."

Minister Maliki also highlighted that COVID-19 had laid bare our inadequacy in dealing with a highly transmissible new disease in an interconnected world, and as such, there was a need to strengthen the global health architecture. Minister Maliki further emphasised that while it was important to bridge the digital divide, especially in education and for small-and medium-sized enterprises, digitalisation was a double-edged sword as cybercrime had become a real threat to governments, businesses and individuals on a global scale. In this regard, international cooperation and public and private sector collaboration was essential to cripple criminal cyber operations and bring perpetrators to justice. The full text of Minister Maliki\u2019s remarks is appended.\nOn the sidelines of the AMM, Minister Maliki met several of his counterparts, including Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea Park Jin and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru Javier Gonz\u00e1lez-Olaechea. The Ministers affirmed warm bilateral ties and discussed opportunities for cooperation. Minister Maliki also expressed Singapore\u2019s support to Minister Gonz\u00e1lez-Olaechea on Peru\u2019s Chairmanship of APEC 2024.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n17 NOVEMBER 2023\nMINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE, SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT SESSION I, \u2018ENABLING AN INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AND AFFIRMING AN EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE FUTURE FOR ALL\u2019 AT THE 2023 APEC MINISTERIAL MEETING IN SAN FRANCISCO, UNITED STATES\nSecretary Blinken\nThe focus of today\u2019s session is salient and I would like to make three points.\nFirst, in recent years, the international community has witnessed a confluence of events which has led to major supply chain disruptions, affecting food and energy security as well as the movement of essential goods. This was keenly felt at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts have similarly led to disruptions. These multiple crises in succession have resulted in, amongst other things, higher costs and economic uncertainty for the man-on-the-street, and in particular, price-takers in small and open economies. It is therefore important that APEC continues its important work in ensuring supply chain resilience. Singapore stands ready to contribute through continuing to lead Phase Three of APEC\u2019s Supply Chain Connectivity Framework Action Plan.\nSecond, COVID-19 laid bare our inadequacy in dealing with a highly transmissible new disease in an interconnected world, and highlighted the need to strengthen the global health architecture. Singapore was one of the first economies to champion \u2018vaccine multilateralism\u2019 and strongly supported the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, which provided an international baseline model for more equitable access to vaccines for all economies.\nWe established and co-chaired the Friends of the COVAX Facility, or FOF, to coalesce global support for this new initiative. We were building the ship as it set sail, but the more important point is that the ship sailed, and this allowed us to save many more lives. A May 2023 report by Imperial College London indicated that COVAX helped to avert 2.7 million deaths across 92 lower-income economies. The FOF has demonstrated the importance of sustainable multilateral solutions to tackling future pandemics which know no borders, and that we can go further if we go together.\nThird, we must capitalise on digitalisation to increase reach to underserved communities. We must also bridge the digital divide, as the pandemic made evident the importance of access to technology, especially in education and for small- and medium-sized enterprises.\nAt the same time, we are beginning to see that digitalisation is a double-edged sword. While it helps cut red-tape and brings about significant efficiencies, criminal elements have also quickly adapted and taken advantage of developments in technology. Cybercrime, such as phishing, ransomware, data breaches and online scams, has become a real threat to governments, businesses and individuals on a global scale. As cybercrime often transcends borders, operating across jurisdictions and affecting victims across various economies, tackling it has been a major challenge, especially in terms of investigation and prosecution. No economy can address this issue alone. Hence, international cooperation and public and private sector collaboration are essential to cripple criminal cyber operations and bring perpetuators to justice.\nColleagues, we live in an interconnected world that, while not perfect and full of challenges, has brought about great benefits to many segments of society over the decades. Singapore looks forward to strengthening our collaboration with fellow APEC economies to build an enabling and innovative environment and to ensure a better future for our next generation. Thank you."

Let me first say that Singapore is very gratified to be the latest Dialogue Partner of the Pacific Islands Forum. Thank you all for your warm welcome. Thank you for your guidance and hospitality, and the chance for me to visit this part of the world for the first time. I recall the words of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka of Fiji \u2013 he talked about the Pacific being once referred to as \u201cthe corner of the world\u201d, but now actually being the centre of the future.\nSingapore, like many of you, was colonised because we missed the Industrial Revolution. That is why we all speak English today. Secondly, like many of you, we were also the theatre of war during the Second World War and (while) we were not privy to those political conflicts, we were victims nevertheless. Our third similarity is that, for most of us, we would claim our independence in the last five or six decades. Our key goal from thereon has been development \u2014 to give our people the skills to master the technologies of the future, jobs, and especially for young people, prospects for the future. A fourth area of similarity is that as small island states, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, climate change is a clear and present threat. The rising sea levels, the high frequency and intensity of storms and droughts, are clear, present and future threats to all our well-being.\nIn the case of Singapore, we view our relations with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as strategic, and it will make a difference for our collective future. Although we are the latest Dialogue Partner, we have longstanding relationships with many of you. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the leaders and Foreign Ministers in this room over the past decade or so.\nSingapore, as a Dialogue Partner, wants to work with you on human capacity development. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992 as a way to pay forward the assistance which Singapore had received decades earlier from the international community and from the multilateral organisations, many of which are represented here today. Over the past 30 years, we have welcomed more than 5,800 Pacific Island officials to Singapore under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.\nWith our accession as a Dialogue Partner, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package, which will be a specially customised three-year programme for the Pacific to support your priorities in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. This programme will run from 2024 to 2026 and focus on three areas: first, climate resilience, second, cybersecurity, and third, international law.\nOn the first point, we will run a modular programme on urban governance, on planning and development to enhance climate resilience. Second, we will make available placements in Singapore\u2019s Cybersecurity Agency\u2019s Cyber Leadership Programme to equip officials with the knowledge on cyber and digital security to support national policymaking and participation in international discussions. I think if any of us think we have not yet been penetrated, it just means we have not discovered it yet. It is a clear and present threat, and we need to approach this both at the operational level \u2013 (with) the engineers, and also at the policy level. We hope to share and exchange ideas with leaders and officials from the Pacific Islands. The third area in which we want to work with you is in international law, and with a particular focus on climate and sea-level rise issues. We will disseminate a factsheet with more details on the SPARKS package separately and welcome feedback from all of you on how we can improve the package and make it more relevant for your needs at the national and regional levels.\nI hope we will be a positive and constructive Dialogue Partner for the PIF, and I invite all of you to visit us on your many expeditions around the world. Thank you very much.\nAnnex B\nFACTSHEET ON THE\nSINGAPORE-PACIFIC RESILIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING (SPARKS) PACKAGE\nAt the 52nd Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) 2050 Thematic Dialogue on 10 November 2023, Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan reaffirmed Singapore\u2019s commitment as a PIF Dialogue Partner to enhance engagement with the Pacific, guided by the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Singapore supports the PIF Leaders\u2019 Vision for 2050 to develop a new generation of leaders who are able to tackle the unique needs of the Pacific to build a resilient Pacific Region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity.\nTo that end, Minister Balakrishnan announced that Singapore will launch a special Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package. The SPARKS package will be provided under the auspices of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), through which Singapore has served as a partner to the Pacific on its development journey for the past 30 years. The SPARKS package, which will run from 2024 to 2026, will focus on supporting the capacity building efforts of the Pacific in the priority areas of climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law to address challenges identified in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. For a start, the SPARKS package will comprise the following programmes:\n(a)Climate Resilience Singapore will offer a customised 3-year modular programme for city leaders and senior officials from PIF members to enhance capacity building in urban governance, planning, and development to achieve climate resilience. The programme, which comprises one module each year over three years, would cover policy frameworks as well as implementation strategies to help cities formulate their development plans, including through preliminary draft planning of their city action plans with the assistance of domain experts. Participants will also learn more about the longer-term strategies for climate resilience and climate change adaptation.\n(b)Cybersecurity. Singapore will offer placement to senior officials from PIF members in Singapore Cyber Security Agency (CSA)\u2019s newly launched SG Cyber Leadership Programme to be delivered through the ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence in Singapore from 2024 to 2026. The programme will comprise Foundational-level and Advanced-level modules which seek to equip officials responsible for national cyber and digital security-related policies with the broad-based training on the operational, technical, legal and diplomatic aspects of cyber and digital security, with the view of providing tools to support national policymaking and participation in regional and international discussions. As part of the programme, participants will have the opportunity to engage with key representatives from industry and various international organisations, as well as other senior officials from regions across the world. Participants in the SG Cyber Leadership Programme can also look forward to future Alumni programmes and resources that will be set up following the first run of the programme in 2024.\n(c)International Law. Singapore will offer up to three runs of an online course on international law, covering topics of direct relevance to the Pacific, such as Climate Change and Ocean issues, the work of the UN International Law Commission on Sea-Level Rise, the preservation of maritime zones, and climate change litigation before domestic and regional courts and human rights treaty bodies. The course aims to provide participants with an understanding of how international law can help address challenges posed by climate change, particularly rising sea levels.\nFor more details on the SPARKS package, please contact the Technical Cooperation Directorate at the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs via Ms Charmaine Yeow, Technical Cooperation Officer at charmaine_yeow@mfa.gov.sg. For enquiries on the cybersecurity programme, please contact CSA\u2019s International Cyber Policy Office via Mr Vikneswaran Selvam, Manager at vikneswaran_selvam@csa.gov.sg, Ms Clara Ho, Manager at clara_ho@csa.gov.sg, and Mr Nasri Sadi, Assistant Manager at muhammad_nasri_sadi@csa.gov.sg"

Under his leadership, China overcame many challenges, pressed on with reform and opening-up, and achieved economic development that dramatically improved the lives of the Chinese people.\nI had the privilege of first meeting Mr Li in Shenyang in 2005, and worked closely with him over the years to strengthen the partnership between Singapore and China. I warmly recall his official visit to Singapore as Premier in 2018, which gave our bilateral cooperation a timely boost.\nThere were several key bilateral milestones during Mr Li\u2019s tenure as Premier, including the establishment of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity; the launch of the Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative; and the upgraded protocol of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Collectively, they reflected the forward-looking nature of the bilateral ties between our two countries.\nMr Li also played an important role in strengthening ASEAN-China cooperation, representing China at ASEAN Summits over the past decade. Today, ASEAN and China are each other\u2019s largest trading partners. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and ASEAN-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership are amongst Mr Li\u2019s lasting contributions to regional integration.\nOur thoughts are with the people of China.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nHis Excellency Li Qiang\nPremier of the State Council\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China"

SMS Sim Ann\u2019s participation in the ACA is part of Singapore\u2019s ongoing engagement of the Arctic region and coincides with the 10th anniversary since Singapore was admitted as an Observer State to the Arctic Council in 2013.\nSMS Sim Ann delivered a speech at the Opening Session of the ACA on 19 October 2023. She highlighted the risks posed by Arctic warming to low-lying small island States like Singapore, and the importance of multilateralism and international cooperation in developing an effective response to climate change-related challenges in the Arctic. The text of SMS Sim Ann\u2019s speech is appended.\nOn the sidelines of the ACA, SMS Sim Ann met Icelandic Foreign Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, as well as former Icelandic President and Arctic Circle Chairman \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson.\nSMS Sim Ann returns to Singapore today.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n20 OCTOBER 2023\nSPEECH BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SIM ANN AT PART II OF THE OPENING SESSION OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE ASSEMBLY, 19 OCTOBER 2023\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Speakers,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n1 I am delighted to be back in Reykjavik for the Arctic Circle Assembly (ACA). This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of ACA in 2013, and I congratulate Arctic Circle Chairman \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson and his team on achieving this milestone.\n2 This year is also the 10th anniversary of Singapore\u2019s Observership at the Arctic Council. As we look back at Singapore\u2019s participation in and contribution to the Arctic over the past decade, including participating in every ACA, it is timely to reaffirm Singapore\u2019s interest in the Arctic and our hopes for the future of Arctic cooperation.\n3 At the global level, the Arctic plays a critical role in regulating the Earth\u2019s ecosystem. It moderates global temperatures and ensures the circulation of ocean currents. Disruptions to the Arctic can therefore upset the balance of ecosystems, with far-reaching consequences on countries as distant as Singapore, which is quite literally half a world away. As the saying goes: What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.\n4 The effects of climate change on the Arctic are well-documented. Over the last 40 years, annual Arctic September sea ice has shrunk by 12.3% per decade. In the last decade alone, the pace of ice loss in the Arctic \u2013 as well as the Antarctic \u2013 has tripled; the Arctic is now warming nearly four times faster than the global average.\n5 For a low-lying coastal State like Singapore, climate change is an existential threat. Around a third of our country is less than five metres above sea level, making us particularly vulnerable to sea level rise caused by melting ice caps.\n6 At the national level, Singapore has launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 \u2013 a whole-of-nation blueprint that charts out ambitious and concrete targets towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes formulating coastal adaptation measures to address sea level rise. We have also launched a National Hydrogen Strategy to accelerate decarbonisation in the energy, industry, maritime and aviation sectors. We are collaborating with industry on hydrogen deployment and investing in innovations in carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS).\n7 Singapore is the only country in Southeast Asia to implement a broad-based carbon tax covering 80% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We plan to raise our carbon tax progressively over the next few years and further enhance the business case for the development and deployment of low-carbon solutions.\n8 While Singapore has taken decisive action to tackle problems associated with climate change, our efforts alone are not enough. After all, Singapore accounts for just 0.11% of global carbon emissions. We have therefore made it a priority to work with and support multilateral forums like the Arctic Council and ACA, to find actionable and sustainable solutions to our shared climate challenges. Through our participation in the Arctic Council Working Groups, we have shared Singapore\u2019s expertise and experience in areas such as the prevention of oil spills, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable energy development. We have also hosted several study visits by the Arctic Council Permanent Participants through the Singapore-Arctic Council Permanent Participants Cooperation Package. Last year, we launched a Sustainability Action Package that covers sustainability themes such as adaptation and resilience, green project management and financing, low carbon development, and carbon markets. We welcome interested Arctic stakeholders to participate in these initiatives so that we can build a better and more sustainable future together.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n9 Given the complex and cross-border nature of the problems associated with Arctic warming, multilateralism and international cooperation remain our best chance at tackling and mitigating these challenges. Singapore therefore welcomes the gradual resumption of Arctic cooperation through the Arctic Council Working Groups, following the temporary pause introduced in March 2022. We look forward to restarting engagements with our Arctic Council partners at the earliest opportunity. On our part, Singapore will continue to draw on our experience and expertise to contribute to the important work of the Arctic Council and the ACA. The Arctic can continue to count on Singapore as a reliable friend and partner in the years to come.

The convening of the inaugural US-Singapore Space Dialogue on 10 October 2023, following Singapore\u2019s signing of the Artemis Accords in 2022, is also another milestone. Both sides also welcomed Singapore and the US expanding the scope of the Singapore-US Third Country Training Programme beyond Southeast Asia, to the Pacific Islands region, which demonstrates our shared commitment to the development priorities of our cooperation partners.\nDPM Wong and his interlocutors also discussed the green energy transition. Despite being alternative energy disadvantaged, Singapore is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Singapore is exploring all possible options to decarbonise our power sector, including emerging technologies like low-carbon hydrogen, and advanced geothermal energy systems. In this context, DPM Wong expressed Singapore\u2019s interest to cooperate with the US to explore the possible role of civilian nuclear energy in the green energy transition. This is part of Singapore\u2019s capability-building efforts to understand the safety and reliability of newer and more advanced nuclear energy technologies. This was welcomed by Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland.\nDPM Wong also spoke at a dialogue at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on 13 October 2023.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\nOCTOBER 2023"

Building on the March 2022 meeting between U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, the United States and Singapore resolve to take bold new steps forward\u2014as friends and strategic partners\u2014to foster open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystems grounded in mutual trust, confidence, and a steadfast commitment to the rules-based international order.\nToday, following up on the leaders\u2019 commitments, Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong delivered opening remarks at the inaugural U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue in Washington, D.C., chaired by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Acting Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology Seth Center (on behalf of Secretary of State Antony Blinken), Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, and Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo. The United States and Singapore commit to upgrade our bilateral partnership to ensure that our combined endeavours at the frontiers of the scientific and technological enterprise continue to serve the global good. This includes our work at the forefront of combatting the climate crisis through the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership, established in 2021 and updated in 2023, to catalyze innovation around low- and zero-emission technologies, including in hard-to-abate sectors such as shipping and aviation, and drive broader regional efforts to decarbonize and deploy renewable energy.\nThe launch of the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue marks the first of several significant steps to build enduring collaboration across our business, scientific, and national security communities with an eye toward delivering benefits for the U.S. and Singaporean people and our partners in ASEAN and across the Indo-Pacific region. We will bolster scientific and research ties across our governments, industries, and university sectors grounded in a commitment to timely exchange of knowledge and information and scientific quality and rigor. We will also explore an appropriate bilateral agreement to expand our science and technology cooperation.\nOur collaboration in this new high-level forum will also complement and accelerate key initiatives across a range of existing bilateral engagements, such as the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation and the U.S.-Singapore Cyber Dialogue. It will support the ambitious agenda we are jointly driving in multilateral economic initiatives, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), to facilitate two-way trade flows, build resilient supply chains, facilitate the clean-energy transition, and combat corruption and enhance the efficiency of tax administration. Looking forward, the United States and Singapore intend to anchor the CET Dialogue and corollary lines of efforts in six main areas, each of which have significant bearing on our shared security and prosperity:\nFinally, as the United States and Singapore continue to lead in the technologies of the future, we will advance close consultations on our respective measures to build a robust innovation ecosystem ensure that emerging technologies work for, and not against, our shared security and prosperity. We will leverage the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue to promote candid and sustained exchanges on risks, opportunities, and key national security implications associated with the rapid advancement of technologies across these six focus areas. The United States and Singapore will discuss our respective approaches to managing risks, bolstering economic resilience, and building trusted technology ecosystems while maintaining our long-standing and shared commitment to open investment.\nThe United States and Singapore look forward to holding the next CET Dialogue in Singapore in 2024, co-chaired by the National Security Council, Department of State, and Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Communications and Information. In the intervening period, we plan to coordinate with key ministries, departments and agencies, and external stakeholders to continue the vital work of bridging our innovation ecosystems to deliver a brighter future for our two peoples and for the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. Our combined commitment to excellence and shared respect for international law, sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of disputes will form the foundation of our national ties, even as we move with greater ambition and ingenuity to propel our strategic partnership into the future.\nPhoto Caption: US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue, 12 October 2023\nPhoto Credits: US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue, 12 October 2023"

I look forward to working with Sri Lanka to advance our mutual interests in IORA. I would also like to thank Bangladesh for steering IORA steadfastly over the last two years. Allow me to also recognise the incoming Vice-Chair of IORA, His Excellency Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs, India.\nWe meet at the critical point in our collective journey to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Yet, we are badly off track\u2014the SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General this April showed insufficient progress on more than half of the SDG targets, with 30 percent showing stagnation or deterioration.\nGiven the confluence of crises from climate change to technological disruptions, today\u2019s theme of \u201cSustainable Development and Partnerships through the Indian Ocean\u201d, is timely. The Indian Ocean is home to nearly three billion people, or about 37% of the world\u2019s population and 53% below the age of 35 years. There is so much at stake for us in the Indian Ocean region. We need to fundamentally shift to put our region and the world on a better path. I will highlight three possible starting points.\nFirst, we need to work urgently to tackle climate change. Over the past few decades, climate change has contributed to rapid sea level rise and warming oceans. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than any other waters since the 1950s. These are worrying trends for small island developing states like Singapore, and those whose lives and livelihoods depend on a healthy ocean.\nSecond, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the benefits of digitalisation. We must seize the opportunities that digital technologies present for sustainable development, without leaving anyone behind. We support efforts toward developing a substantive Global Digital Compact, which should encourage digital inclusion including access to resources, promote innovation, and enhance interoperability.\nThird, international cooperation and a rules-based multilateral system are critical to create a conducive environment for sustainable development. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 demonstrated how multilateralism can respond to new challenges, especially when there is political will and collective commitment.\nAs a small but open island state with no natural resources, Singapore is a firm believer of the sustainable development model. We presented our second Voluntary National Review in July this year, and have raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\nWe are strong supporters of multilateralism. To that end, we have convened and hosted sustainability-focused events, and exchanged experiences with fellow developing countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme. We also launched the Sustainability Action Package last year, which supports capacity-building on a wide range of topics, including adaptation and mitigation strategies, carbon markets and green finance, among others.\nExcellencies\nLadies and Gentlemen\nOur shared survival relies on our urgent and transformative efforts to rescue the SDGs. Singapore stands ready to work with IORA to build a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive future that leaves no one behind. Thank you.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n11 OCTOBER 2023"

She had good discussions with these leaders, particularly on how Small Island Developing States can cooperate on climate change adaptation strategies.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n11 OCTOBER 2023\nREMARKS BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE (SMS), MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SIM ANN AT THE 1ST HIGH-LEVEL MEETING OF THE ARCHIPELAGIC AND ISLAND STATES FORUM IN BALI, INDONESIA, 11 OCTOBER 2023\nYour Excellency Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet me first express Singapore\u2019s appreciation to Indonesia for hosting this meeting and the UNDP for its invaluable support to the AIS Forum.\nSingapore appreciates the opportunity to participate in the AIS Forum, and we welcome the spotlight that the AIS Forum has shone on climate change-related issues. These are existential issues faced by Small Island Developing States such as Singapore and many others represented here today. Singapore remains committed to supporting global climate action, with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda serving as key tools to map out such action. For the sake of our collective future, we must all put in more effort to build green, inclusive, and resilient societies.\nIn 2021, Singapore unveiled our Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation sustainability agenda that commits Singapore to ambitious and concrete sectoral targets until 2030. With a goal of greening 80% of our buildings by 2030, the Green Plan will help to fulfil our obligations under the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and put us in a strong position to achieve our target of net-zero emissions by 2050.\nHowever, Singapore\u2019s climate action alone is insufficient, as we only account for 0.1% of global emissions. A more concerted global effort is required. As a small island city state and a key maritime hub, Singapore recognises the importance of working together, supported by strong multilateral institutions and cross-border cooperation. Let me focus on three key areas: climate change and adaptation; marine plastics; and maritime governance.\nFirst, on climate change and adaptation, Singapore is committed to collaborating with like-minded partners to support capacity-building for developing countries, through platforms such as the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), which is our flagship technical assistance programme. In the past 30 years, we have conducted more than 200 courses on sustainability, climate change, and disaster management for over 9,800 foreign government officials from more than 170 countries, territories and intergovernmental organisations. In 2022, we launched the Sustainability Action Package (SAP). Running from April 2023 to March 2026, the SAP provides more targeted sustainability-related courses in key areas such as adaptation and resilience-building strategies; green project management and financing; low carbon development; and carbon markets. In the last six months alone, we have conducted over 10 courses for more than 200 participants from over 70 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations. We look forward to sharing the experiences we have gained over the years, and we encourage more officials to participate in the SCP and the SAP programmes.\nSecond, on marine pollution and plastics, Singapore is actively participating in negotiations at both the UN and the IMO. We are pleased that the UN Environment Assembly adopted a resolution in March 2022 to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop a new global treaty to tackle plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. Singapore will continue to participate actively and work with Member States to achieve an outcome that emphasises and addresses the transboundary impact of marine plastic pollution, takes a pragmatic approach, and galvanises global action. At the IMO, Singapore is party to all six Annexes of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. We look forward to working with Member States on a constructive strategy to deal with ship-source plastic spills and pollution.\nThird, on the need for strong maritime governance, Singapore is heartened to see the warm reception enjoyed by the BBNJ Agreement, which has more than 80 signatories so far, more than 20 of which are from the Small Island Developing States. We encourage more states to sign and swiftly ratify the treaty, which would represent a major step forward in the governance of our global commons. We are proud that Ambassador Rena Lee, a Singaporean who served as the President of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference, was successful in helping delegations bridge their differences and come to a successful conclusion. Singapore will continue to take an active role on the international stage in the strengthening of our multilateral frameworks. Of course, this outcome could not be achieved without the cooperation of all the other delegations. Amidst an increasingly gloomy global outlook, the success of the BBNJ process is proof that our leaders can come together to solve pressing problems.\nFinally, Singapore notes the discussions undertaken by our Ministers and Senior Officials regarding the Leaders\u2019 Declaration and looks forward to its adoption later today. Our officials should continue discussions on the proposed AIS Organisation\u2019s future, including its charter, targets as well as objectives. Given the growing importance of climate change and marine pollution-related issues to all our countries, Singapore firmly believes that we should work together, through this and other multilateral platforms, to strengthen our collective ability to address the many common, urgent, complex, and existential challenges facing us today. Thank you."

The reception was held at the historic Engel Hall in the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Helsinki and was attended by over 80 guests, including Overseas Singaporeans living in Finland and other Finnish officials from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education and Culture, National Agency for Education, and Business Finland.\nIn his remarks delivered during the reception, Minister Maliki noted that Singapore and Finland shared many similarities and like-mindedness that make the two countries natural partners. Bilaterally, Singapore and Finland enjoy good cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, research and development, education, urban planning and social policies. Multilaterally, Singapore and Finland are members of ASEAN and the EU respectively, and the EU is a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN. Both countries are also members of the Forum of Small States and the Global Governance Group (3G) at the United Nations. The joint reception was therefore both a culmination as well as a celebration of the last 50 years of bilateral cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, building on earlier commemorative activities such as the tree-planting activities at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in Singapore and Kalasatama Park in Helsinki.\nThe joint reception was held in conjunction with Minister Maliki\u2019s study visit to Finland to learn more about Finland\u2019s inclusive approach for students with special education needs; early childhood education; technical and vocational education and training; and lifelong learning. During the visit, Minister Maliki also called on Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Her Excellency Elina Valtonen and witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ITE Singapore and the Turku Vocational Institute. Minister Maliki was accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, and ITE Singapore.\nTranscript of Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Education, and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Maliki Osman\u2019s Remarks at the Joint Reception\nMr Lauri Tierala, State Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence\nProfessor Cheong Koon Hean, Ambassador of Singapore to Finland,\nDr Karl Heikki Ky\u00f6stil\u00e4, Honorary Consul-General of Singapore in Helsinki,\nFellow Singaporeans,\nDistinguished Guests,\nLadies, and Gentlemen,\nIt is a great pleasure for me to be here at tonight\u2019s reception to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Finland this year. I would like to thank State Secretary Tierala and the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the gracious hospitality and agreeing to co-host tonight\u2019s reception, so that we can celebrate this significant milestone together.\nEven though we are located far from each other, Singapore and Finland share many similarities. Our populations are about the same size \u2013 around five and a half million people for Finland, and close to six million for Singapore \u2013 although geographically Finland is much larger than Singapore. Our economies are highly industrialised with a highly skilled workforce; and we believe in and firmly support multilateralism and free trade. These similarities and like-mindedness make Singapore and Finland natural partners \u2013 both bilaterally as well as at multilateral fora like the UN.\nMultilaterally, Singapore and Finland are members of ASEAN and the EU respectively, and the EU is a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN. Our countries are also members of the Forum of Small States and the Global Governance Group (3G) at the UN, where we work together to champion issues of concern to small states. Bilaterally, we enjoy good cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, research and development, education, urban planning and social policies.\nIn fact, I am visiting Finland under my separate \u2018hat\u2019 as Second Minister for Education to learn more about Finland\u2019s education system, in particular Finland\u2019s inclusive approach for students with special education needs; early childhood education; technical and vocational education and training; and lifelong learning. I am therefore happy to share that accompanying me is a delegation from Singapore\u2019s Institute of Technical Education (ITE), who will be renewing their partnership with the Turku Vocational Institute.\nBesides ITE, our Institutes of Higher Learning such as the National University of Singapore and the Singapore University of Technology and Design also have regular exchanges with Finnish higher education institutes. Just last year, a group of students from the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music came to the Sibelius Academy of the University of the Arts Helsinki to learn from renowned Finnish conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste.\nSingaporeans are also familiar with Finnish products and your beautiful landscapes. Many of us will remember owning a Nokia as our first mobile phone with voice activated technology to make calls. Lapland always comes to mind when Singaporeans want to travel to see the Northern Lights.\nTonight\u2019s reception is therefore both a culmination as well as a celebration of the last 50 years of bilateral cooperation and the excellent people-to-people exchanges between our two countries. It also builds on other commemorative activities that have taken place over the year, such as the tree-planting activities at the historic Singapore Botanic Gardens in Singapore and Kalasatama Park in Helsinki. The trees not only symbolise our flourishing bilateral ties but are also testament to Singapore and Finland\u2019s shared commitment towards sustainability and climate conservation. I encourage you to visit the trees if you are at the Singapore Botanic Gardens or Kalasatama Park.\nBefore I wrap up my remarks, I am pleased to note that tonight we will also enjoy a piano performance by a fellow Singaporean: Jeremy Wong and his partner, Chen Qu. Jeremy is an accomplished pianist and doctoral candidate at the Sibelius Academy at the University of the Arts in Helsinki, and one of the many Singaporeans who have come to Finland to live, work, and study. Jeremy, together with every Singaporean in Finland, play important roles as our ambassadors on the ground, promoting cross-cultural and people-to-people ties between Singapore and Finland. I hope they will continue to play this role and help strengthen Singapore-Finland relations for the next 50 years and more.\nAbout Singapore-Finland Relations\nSingapore and Finland established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1973. Our political leaders have had regular exchanges on the sidelines of international fora, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan meeting Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Her Excellency Elina Valtonen on the sidelines of the 78th United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2023. Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and Second Minister for Education, and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Maliki Osman met Minister Valtonen at the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October 2023.\nThere are more than 200 Finnish companies in Singapore, including Neste Oil, the world\u2019s largest supplier of renewable diesel, and Nokia. Our education institutes have forged partnerships with Finnish institutes of higher education and with regular exchanges between students of both countries.\nFinland is also a strong supporter of Singapore\u2019s observership at the Arctic Council. We have collaborated with the Finnish Embassy and the Canadian High Commission to organise the \u201cIce in the Tropics\u201d seminar and photo exhibition in November 2017 to raise public awareness on Arctic issues in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\nSingapore is represented by Non-Resident Ambassador to Finland Professor Cheong Koon Hean, and our Honorary Consul-General in Helsinki Dr Karl Heikki Ky\u00f6stil\u00e4. Finland is represented in Singapore by Ambassador-designate Juha Markkanen since September 2023.\nMinister Maliki with distinguished guests at the joint reception\n[L to R: Finnish Undersecretary of State for International Trade Jarno Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, Ambassador-designate to Singapore Juha Markkanen, Ambassador to Finland Professor Cheong Koon Hean, Minister Maliki Osman, State Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defence Lauri Tierala, Honorary Consul-General of Singapore in Helsinki Dr Karl Heikki Ky\u00f6stil\u00e4 and partner Tuula Laaksonen]\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister Maliki with Singaporeans in Finland at the reception, along with Trade Counsellor at the Finnish Embassy in Singapore Irma Ylikangas and Finnish Special Envoy for Ukraine Reconstruction and former Ambassador to Singapore Antti V\u00e4nsk\u00e4.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

He also urged UN Member States to accept and respect the diversity of views in the multilateral systemMinister Balakrishnan highlighted the urgency in starting an inclusive global dialogue on AI at the UN. Singapore welcomes the UN Secretary-General\u2019s decision to convene a High-Level Advisory Body on AI.\nThe transcript of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s national statement is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n23 SEPTEMBER 2023\nNATIONAL STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nDR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO THE 78TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, NEW YORK\n22 SEPTEMBER 2023\nBuilding a Future-Proof United Nations and Multilateral System\nMr President\nI congratulate His Excellency Dennis Francis on assuming the Presidency of the 78th session of the General Assembly. We are delighted that a fellow member of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) has been elected to the highest office in the General Assembly. I also thank His Excellency Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si for his adept stewardship of the 77th session during a very challenging year.\nOur world is a troubled place. The COVID-19 pandemic was a global test of equity, of governance, and of preparedness. But quite frankly, our world came up short. We are still dealing with its sequelae \u2013 in healthcare and education, and the long-term impact on our world economy and on global solidarity.\nThe recent natural disasters in fact underline our common vulnerability as nations on the same planet. Nature is a force that does not respect borders. Our hearts go out to the victims of the earthquakes in Morocco and Turkey, and the floods in Libya. There are looming food and water crises. And if we miss our climate change targets, we will heap even more misery upon ourselves and on future generations.\nBeyond the devastation caused by pandemics and natural disasters, we have created purely man-made tragedies as well. The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to rage on. It is a full-frontal assault on the UN Charter and a flagrant violation of international law. Global food security has been aggravated by the war in Ukraine as well as by climate change, which will add to inflationary pressures everywhere. In ASEAN, in my part of the world, the violent coup in Myanmar has deprived the people of Myanmar of the peace and development that they so richly need and deserve. Our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters in Myanmar.\nThis perfect storm is aggravated by political dysfunction almost everywhere \u2013 fractious hyper polarised domestic politics, the disillusionment with globalisation and multilateralism, and the lack of strategic trust between countries, and if I may add, especially between the superpowers. This dysfunction hobbles our ability to deal with the planetary crises that go beyond the ability of any single superpower or even blocs of countries to overcome. In fact, all countries need to work together to build coherent and realistic multilateral solutions.\nSingapore is a tiny, vulnerable, open island city state, and therefore we have to strongly support the United Nations and the indispensable rules-based multilateral system. It provides a stable framework for us to thrive, to exercise our autonomy, and to chart our own future for our own people.\nI was glad to see the urgent focus on these issues during this year\u2019s High-Level Week. The SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Summit shows that we have fallen behind our targets. The Climate Ambition Summit, the three High-Level Meetings on Health, and the preparatory meeting for the Summit of the Future help us to re-calibrate the multilateral system.\nI wish to put forward three principles that should guide our collective efforts to make our multilateral system more resilient and ready for the future.\nFirstwe should reaffirm our commitment to building a multilateral system that reflects our enlightened long-term interests as a global community. Unfortunately, the world today is marked by even sharper geopolitical rivalry. Free trade is in retreat, and supply chains are being fragmented. This unravels the gains that we have painstakingly made over many decades by competing and contributing to a common global technology stack.\nWe must avoid turning competition into a zero-sum game. Whether we are addressing climate change, outer space, or technology standards, it is important for all countries to balance our national interests with the collective long-term interests of our global community.\nThis means that Member States need to work constructively and in good faith within the multilateral framework, keeping our enlightened common interests in mind. The need for compromise and mutual understanding is a feature; it is not a bug of the multilateral system. In the face of the planetary challenges that we face, there is no winner who can take it all.\nSecondUN Member States should accept and respect the diversity of experiences, systems, concepts and ideas within the multilateral system. This is borne out of our rich tapestry of cultures, religions and social normsWe must recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all template for how a country should organise itself. No one has a monopoly on culture or wisdom, and we should resist the arrogant temptation to remake others in our own image.\nThe rich diversity of peoples and nations everywhere, in fact, can lead to fertile cross-fertilisation of ideas, and development of even more policy options to deal with the many challenges that we face.\nThe UN is an indispensable platform for countries to share our experiences in areas from sustainable development to human rights, and where we can learn from one another. The Summit of the Future gives us an opportunity to strengthen the multilateral system by taking into account diverse points of view and building a common framework for our future.\nThe third point I want to make is that in the midst of the digital revolution and especially the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we must prepare for both the risks, and also distribute the benefits of these technologies more fairly. In the past year, generative AI \u2013 ChatGPT \u2013 has captured popular imagination. Actually, we are already on the verge of the next stage \u2013 AI agents with the ability to negotiate and transact with each other and with humans. Often, you would not be able to tell the difference. This has profound implications on all our societies, on our politics, and our economies everywhere. Autonomous weapon systems without human fingers on the trigger are already with us \u2013 witness the wars around us.\nAs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening of the General Assembly this week, \u201cgenerative AI holds much promise, but it may also lead us across a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control\u201d. This is especially so in the theatre of war and peace.\nAI will fundamentally disrupt our assumptions on military doctrines and strategic deterrence. For example, the speed at which AI-enabled weapons systems can be almost instantaneously deployed and triggered will dramatically reduce decision times for our leaders. There will be many occasions when humans may not even be in the firing loop, but we will be on the firing line. This would inevitably heighten the risk of unintended conflicts, or the escalation of conflicts.\nDuring the Cold War, the sense of \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d imposed mutual restraint \u2013 although we now know, in fact, there were several close shaves. This spectre of nuclear escalation has not disappeared. Yet, the advent of Artificial Intelligence in conflict situations has actually increased the risks exponentially. So, we must start an inclusive global dialogue and we must start it at the United Nations. We need to urgently consider oversight of such systems and the necessary precautions to avoid miscalculations.\nIn fact, this is just one facet of many as we focus our minds on how to harness the potential and to manage the risks of AI. Singapore welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to convene a High-Level Advisory Body on AI to explore these critical issues.\nSingapore is optimistic that the UN and the multilateral system will be up to the task of establishing norms on these fast-emerging critical technologies. The UN Open-Ended Working Group on ICT Security, which happens to be chaired by Singapore, has made steady progress and this offers some useful lessons for other areas, including AI. Singapore commits to continue to support all efforts to promote international cooperation and to strengthen global rules, norms and principles in the digital domain. We also look forward to the adoption of the Global Digital Compact at the Summit of the Future in 2024.\nThe reality is that many nations are not ready for the wave of digital transformation sweeping our world. We should not forget that even today, more than two billion people still have no internet access, and we need to work far harder to bridge that digital divide. As a tiny city state, Singapore is committed to supporting other small states by raising awareness, sharing experiences and building human capacity everywhere. In 2022, Singapore launched Digital FOSS, a platform for members of the Forum of Small States to learn from and to mutually support each other in the area of digital technologies. There is no doubt that these technologies are a powerful accelerator for sustainable development in developing countries, and all the more so in small states like us. But many developing countries and small states will need help to deploy and to harness the benefits of these technologies.\nMr President,\nAs the most inclusive and universal body in the world, the United Nations has to be at the centre of our collective efforts to address these global challenges. We can do so \u2013 as shown in fact by the recent adoption of the legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. I am referring to the BBNJ Agreement (Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction).\nSingapore is honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee served as the President of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference. She worked tirelessly and closely with all delegations to bring that ship safely to harbour. This week, I was proud to sign the BBNJ Agreement on behalf of Singapore, and Singapore intends to ratify this as soon as possible. We call on all UN Member States to sign and to ratify the BBNJ Agreement so that it can enter into force early, and I am glad that as of today, I believe 81 Member States have signed the BBNJ Agreement.\nWe need to bring this same constructive spirit to the other areas of the global commons, AI, cyber security, digital technology even outer space. We do not lack policy ideas on strengthening multilateralism, but we need commitment and action. The High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism has put forward six \u201ctransformational shifts\u201d[1] which will make the UN and the multilateral system future-ready. For many small states, our survival, our very success requires a strong United Nations and an effective multilateral system founded on the UN Charter and international law, and complied with by all states in the world. The Forum of Small States, chaired by Singapore, will continue to work with all states, large and small, to make the UN stronger and ready for the future.\nMr President,\nThe Summit of the Future next year will be a crucial milestone to re-position the United Nations and the multilateral system for our future. This Summit is also an opportunity to further accelerate the implementation of the SDGs. Singapore will work closely with all UN Member States and we will contribute constructively to this process. We call on all delegations everywhere to take a pragmatic and action-oriented approach towards the Summit. It is not too late for us to work together to build a better, safer and fairer world for all countries and especially for our future generations. Thank you very much.\n[1] The six transformative shifts are: (a) rebuild trust in multilateralism; (b) planet and people; (c) global finance; (d) digital and data governance; (e) peace and prevention; and (f) anticipatory action.Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs SingaporeMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs SingaporeMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs SingaporeMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\n[1] The six transformative shifts are: (a) rebuild trust in multilateralism; (b) planet and people; (c) global finance; (d) digital and data governance; (e) peace and prevention; and (f) anticipatory action.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s national statement to the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

Let me again repeat his welcome to all of you for joining us. To get so many of you in one place is already a major achievement. So, thank you for being here.\nWe have all emerged from the worst of the COVID pandemic. You do not see many people with masks, which is quite different from last year and the year before that, when we had to do things virtually. But the world remains a troubled place; the conflict in Ukraine continues, no imminent prospect of peace seems to be available. Yet, we are also facing planetary level challenges, climate change continues. We are behind schedule in terms of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There are also natural disasters, earthquakes in Morocco, Turkey earlier on, as well as the floods in Libya. If you add the natural disasters and the man-made disasters, our hands are full.\nIf you want to add even more excitement, there is the whole digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution. I think generative AI has captured popular imagination, but many people may not realise that just behind the curtain are, in my view, AI agents with the ability to negotiate and transact with each other and with human beings. That is going to have a profound impact on our societies, politics and economies. If you come back to the war in Ukraine, there are autonomous weapon systems, sometimes with no human finger on the trigger. That is already a reality, and that has got a profound impact on war and peace.\nWe are all small states here, and I just want to add that we are the majority in the United Nations (UN). There are 108 countries who constitute the Forum of Small States (FOSS). We are here to make common cause, to reaffirm our shared commitment to multilateralism and to international law, because in a sense, for small states, that is the only game in town. We have, by definition and by necessity, to subscribe to and to operate on the basis of multilateralism and a rule-based international order.\nTherefore, we need to amplify our voice, and we need to help shape international norms, including technical standards, in order to have a level playing field and leave no country behind. And to do all that, while protecting the global commons.\nI believe we have a generational opportunity to do so. Three days ago, we had the SDG Summit, where we discussed how we need to accelerate, to get that sense of urgency for the fulfillment of SDG goals. Unfortunately, I think you all know, we are behind time. Earlier today, at the Summit of the Future Preparatory Meeting, Member States discussed how we could breathe new life into the multilateral system, to deliver on the 2030 Agenda, and to deal with the challenges of tomorrow while dealing with the problems of today.\nThere are all these interconnected issues and we need to make common cause and work together. Many of these initiatives, including the SDG Summit Political Declaration and the Summit of the Future, are facilitated by the Permanent Representatives (PRs) of FOSS Member States. I know we try to get together once a year, but I want to report to our Foreign Ministers here that our PRs work very hard year after year. They get the real work done. We also use FOSS as a clearing house for information, insights, capacity building, and empowering and enabling each of our respective delegations.\nAt the same time, we are also discussing the Global Digital Compact facilitated by the PRs of FOSS Members, Rwanda and Sweden. Digital technology will gain greater prominence in the future. This is one opportunity for us, although we are small, to connect ourselves globally, and to make a difference. To reshape the norms, so that we will not be left behind.\nOn the part of Singapore, we are committed to maintaining FOSS as a platform for small states to help each other prepare for the future. Last year, we launched a Digital FOSS, aimed at providing a space for us to exchange ideas on our respective digital transformation journeys and to build a common digital future, including through building a Global Digital Compact.\nOn this note, let me again thank all of you for being here. Thank you for empowering your Permanent Representatives to do what they do best. Let us toast to the future of small states \u2013 may we always preserve our strategic autonomy, our collective voice, and protect and nurture the future for our people.\nThank you all very much. I wish you all the very best.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman at the Forum of Small States Reception, 21 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

First, let me begin with an apology. I am speaking to you all from New York. I am here for the UN (United Nations) General Assembly. That is why I am not upfront and close in front of you. But I am looking forward to a great session.\nI wanted you to first understand that Singapore is a tiny place. Think of Manhattan, being ejected by upstate New York and having to be an independent nation. I know some people might actually want it. But I can tell you, I can assure you, it is a very difficult challenge. So, we tend to look at the world through a very real, realistic set of lenses. I just want to congratulate Eric (Schmidt) for getting this special competitive studies project.\nThere is just one point I want to start off on and I thought I will leave it for you to consider.\nThere is a big difference between competition and competitiveness. For instance, merely having two superpowers compete, that is competition. Having lots of small companies competing, that is competition. The real question is competitiveness. In Singapore, it is the latter that we are focused on. If you think of it through that prism, then the question becomes, what are the key ingredients for competitiveness, especially for a small, tiny city state in the heart of Southeast Asia, who has got excellent relations with both the United States and China, and whose trade volume is three times our GDP.\nHaving set that context, the most important ingredient for competitiveness is people. That means getting immigration policy right, getting education policy right, getting adult education right. It means having appropriate educational institutions, it means reforming university education, because quite frankly, the way university education has been delivered so far is based on the old Industrial Revolution. That is the first point; people, education, soft skills.\nThe second point is infrastructure. In Singapore, every single home, every single office has got two fibers leading to each home. We are now aiming to deliver ten gigabit access to every home. Of course, you pay for it, but it is cost competitive. There is no question for us on having first world infrastructure; transport, connectivity, fiber, 5G is essential.\nThe next point is that you need to get the right balance between government, private sector, and even civil society. Because this is not something that one party alone can execute. Specifically for government, the greatest challenge for government innovation is not technical. It is policy. Getting the policies right, which stimulate innovation, which protect intellectual property, but in a way that does not lock down competition and competitiveness, and which encourages companies to compete and offer products and services on a level playing field. To use another example \u2013 autonomous vehicles. That has been invented, but getting the policy and the insurance frameworks right, to enable it to be rolled out and to be rolled out safely and securely, that is where policy innovation is needed.\nThe final ingredient I would make also has got to do with the difference between intellectual property - patents, sharing and competing globally - versus going back to the old model, which goes back a couple of centuries, of trade secrets and trademarks, where you hide your discoveries, you hope no one else gets to it, and you believe you get an advantage from it. What we enjoy in this day and age is a global, single application stack of innovation, the production of new products and services, and competition. Everybody is working and competing within that same operating system. That is why you have got patents. That is (what) modern intellectual property protection is founded on. I am making the point that this has been a dynamo for competitiveness, growth and innovation, and progress and peace that we have enjoyed for the last seven decades.\nThere is a difference between what happened when there was the USSR competing with the United States, where there were really two separate technological and even intellectual ecosystems. The difference with today when you are competing with China is that you are actually competing within the same intellectual ecosystem. Therefore, one awkward point which we need to decide, is even as both superpowers strive to be more competitive, what will the rules of that engagement be? We need, or we hope, that there will be a global eco-system, which is competitive, which induces innovation, creates a level playing field, creates interdependence and hopefully, maintains that formula for peace and prosperity.\nMaybe let me stop there. I think I have put enough on the table for us to have a robust discussion on.\nJeanne Meserve: Indeed, you have put a lot on the table here. I want to follow up on some of the points that you made. So, Singapore has had tremendous success attracting technology firms, attracting venture capital. You have mentioned some of the factors. I would like you to dig in a little bit deeper on some of them. Obviously, you have a stable government \u2013\nMinister: That helps.\nJeanne: Yes.\nMinister: It is not just a stable government, but a government which can afford to think long-term beyond the next election.\nJeanne: Geographically, you are small, as you mentioned, which makes some things possible. You have also got a very strategic location in Southeast Asia. So that is a plus for you.\nBut talk a little bit more, if you would, about the immigration policies that you have implemented and how you are using those to attract talent to Singapore?\nMinister: First, it helps that in Singapore, we are small, we are a young nation, we are multiracial, multilingual. We use English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil. We are comfortable hearing different languages, smelling different foods, getting on with different cultures, and engaging in cultural and intellectual arbitrage. That helps \u2013 a confident, open, welcoming population.\nNow, that does not mean from time to time, you will not have political pushback against foreigners, against competition, against globalisation. But it helps that Singapore is so small and so trade dependent that we have to make a living by servicing the world. Everyone knows we need to remain open \u2013 that helps. It helps focus the mind.\nThe next thing is to be completely meritocratic about it. If someone wants to enter Singapore, wants to start a business or wants to enter (an) university, show us what you are made of. Why are you more valuable than the next applicant in line? I need to tell you that we have a long list of applicants in the queue. So, maintaining that rational, logical and consistent approach to immigration.\nIf you think about (the) Silicon Valley, you look at the success of the companies, you look at the leadership of the companies, both at the management level and the technical level, it is fueled by immigration and meritocracy. That is essential.\nJeanne: You are attracting some of the best and some of the brightest to come to Singapore to start up businesses or work in businesses. In addition, as you mentioned, you have educated your own population \u2013\nMinister: Yes.\nJeanne: To provide them (with) the skills that they need. Talk to us about how you have instituted that and how widespread it is.\nMinister: My Prime Minister is a mathematician. It used to be that more than half the Cabinet consisted of engineers. I am a surgeon. So, when we talk to tech companies, or science companies, they know we get it, we understand, that we are literate in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Having a Cabinet and having a bureaucracy that gets it and is supportive of people with the skills which just so happen to be in demand right now is very helpful.\nSecond point, however, is that it is not all engineers. In fact, if you think about the products and services now, you do need people with artistic ability, people who are able to communicate, to persuade, to resonate at an emotional level. The key is to construct teams with a multi-disciplinary approach. The other point is that if you ever wanted to assemble a multi-national team consisting of Americans, Russians, Ukrainians, Chinese, and Indians, the easiest place in the world to assemble such a multiracial, diverse, elite group of talent ought to be Singapore. Now, I should also add, we cannot compete with (the) Silicon Valley \u2013 we do not have the scale. What Singapore aims to do is to be a critical node in a global value chain, which includes America, which includes China, India, Europe, and increasingly, I see great options in South America and Africa as well. We are a node, we are a connecting point.\nFor the members in the audience, if you just Google submarine cables in Singapore, look at the distribution of submarine cables that terminate in Singapore or originate from Singapore. It is that map which I spend more time looking at nowadays rather than just the sea routes and the air routes.\nJeanne: As you have mentioned, you have good relations with both the US and with China. You are the Foreign Minister.\nMinister: That is my day job.\nJeanne: How are you going to maintain it? If, for instance, there is military action against Taiwan?\nMinister: First of all, we hope there will not be. Taiwan is the most proximate red fuse and it calls for great caution. Hopefully, cool heads and rationality will prevail.\nI have spent a lot of hours discussing this issue with Henry Kissinger. The genius of Henry Kissinger, Zhou Enlai, and Mao Zedong, 50 years ago, was to acknowledge that this was a sensitive issue. This was an issue which was not going to be solved in their generation. To create the strategic ambiguity, which maintained the peace, that China did not aim to forcibly reunify with Taiwan. At the same time, Taiwan did not aim to become an independent political entity.\nNow, that is 50 years ago. Time has passed. The power asymmetry between the United States and China has changed. Nevertheless, the long-term diplomatic objective of maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait remains essential.\nNow, Singapore is not going to be able to solve this. We are not in the Taiwan Strait, fortunately. But what I can say from direct observation and interaction with the top leadership in both the United States and China is that neither side is spoiling for war.\nBut, as I said, circumstances have changed, and just as importantly, domestic politics has changed. I can tell you, as a Foreign Minister, foreign policy actually begins at home. How confident are you of your country's prospects? How unified are your people? Are the ingredients for further progress, innovation and competitiveness, stable and encouraging on your home-front?\nIf you have two superpowers who are confident, coherent and consistent, you have the ingredients for peace. So, I would still say that peace is possible. You have to take precautions, but the most important ingredient the two superpowers need is strategic trust. The point which I have been making repeatedly is that you need people to meet face-to-face, in person, to look into each other's eyes and shake hands. I know we are using Zoom right now, but it will not suffice for honest to goodness conversations and resolving sensitive and difficult challenges. So, that is what we encourage.\nJeanne: Speaking of conversations, you had one this week with Secretary (Antony) Blinken, in which you discussed using AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a force for good \u2013\nMinister: Yes.\nJeanne: How do you believe this technology can be used to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?\nMinister: There is a lot of buzz nowadays about AI because of generative AI. Not only can Artificial Intelligence now classify cats or translate languages, it can generate even the session which we have today. But, actually, I think there is a \u2013\nJeanne: You are real though, are you? You are not fake \u2013\nMinister: I am real.\nJeanne: Okay.\nMinister: I think there is a bigger thing waiting right now. That is, AI agents with transactional ability, which means the ability to negotiate, ability to transact, the ability to buy and sell, and convince, and to mobilise. I think that is happening sooner than people realise.\nBy all means, be excited about generative AI, but start thinking about AI agents with transactional ability. Now, once you start thinking about that, there are several issues which governments need to tackle. At the lowest level, it is about jobs. It is about skillsets. It is about education, training, and infrastructure. That is almost easy. I say almost easy because it is not necessarily a trivial point, but you can do that. You have got to give people confidence that they will be equipped with the skills to ride these new tools, be masters of the tools rather than to be made redundant because of those tools. That is one level.\nThere is another level, which is the political level, which is if you have AI agents now with the ability to transact, to mobilise, to organise, to both customise the message as well as target the message to the appropriate demographic, political groups, politics, as we know it, if you talk about democracy - it is going to be upended by technology. Again, if we do not come to grips with this impact on our politics, I think even the current dysfunction is going to make it much worse. That is the second level.\nThe third level, which I worry about from a foreign policy point of view, is, if you go back, again, to the contest between the Soviet Union and the United States, and nuclear weapons, and mutually assured destruction and deterrence, you got to a level where both sides knew it would be bad news to go to war. In fact, you need to set hot lines, you need to set the rules of engagement. You could even embark on discussions on strategic limitations, arms limitations.\nWe are now in the day and age, even in Ukraine - drones, autonomous weapons, swarms. The truth is, you are now at a level where the finger on the trigger is not a human, but it is actually a machine system. Because there are so many targets coming in at the same time, you cannot afford to have a human on every single trigger.\nNow that is at a tactical, operational level. But think about it at a strategic level. How much time will a future President have to make a decision, to press the ultimate button, given the fact that AI systems will be deeply embedded in both tactical and strategic systems, and a lot of this will be outsourced? Yet we know as human beings, our decision-making ability, our time needed to think, and to arrive at a conclusion or even to use intuition, that has not changed. So, I do worry. This is something which Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger have worried about, and in their book published two years ago. I am deeply worried about this. Those are the three levels I think about. The impact of AI agents with transactional ability, with access to triggers and prompts, and their ability ultimately to even self-improve recursively. So, I do worry.\nJeanne: We are out of time, but in a word, given all you have said, are you excited about AI? Are you terrified by AI?\nMinister: Oh, both. I am excited because I think this is the biggest technological break-through in our lifetime. But I am also sufficiently worried, to raise alarms, or at least to get people to start thinking and worrying and figuring out those guardrails. We need this within our societies, and in particular to prevent further erosion of our democracies. We also need this at a strategic level to keep the peace and maintain mutual deterrence.\nJeanne: Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Foreign Minister of Singapore, thanks so much for joining us today.\nMinister: Thank you."

The meeting will set the agenda for the \u2018Summit of the Future\u2019, an initiative under the UN Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Our Common Agenda\u2019 report, to be held in 2024. The Summit is envisioned to produce a \u2018Pact of the Future\u2019 that would revitalise the multilateral system, ensure that it is equipped to address pressing global challenges, and bring the international community back on track in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nMinister Maliki spoke about the urgent need to defend multilateralism and for Member States to commit to ensuring that the UN remains fit for purpose. Minister Maliki called for action-oriented strategies to accelerate achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to close the widening development gap. Minister Maliki also underscored the importance of developing norms in new and emerging frontiers like Artificial Intelligence, cyber, and outer space, underpinned by a strong adherence to the UN Charter and international law. He reaffirmed Singapore\u2019s support for initiatives like the Global Digital Compact, which would serve as a blueprint for countries to seize the opportunities presented by digital transformation, guided by the principles of digital inclusion, innovation, and interoperability. Minister Maliki also stressed the importance of transforming global governance to protect our global commons, including through reform of the international financial architecture. Singapore is committed to working constructively with Member States to achieve a substantive and actionable Pact of the Future at the Summit in 2024.\nMinister Maliki\u2019s statementis appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n21 SEPTEMBER 2023\nMr President, the Summit of the Future is a generational opportunity for the international community to reinvigorate and strengthen the multilateral system and the UN, to ensure they are relevant, resilient, and fit for purpose. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder that, in an inter-connected world, no one country can deal with global shocks alone. This is why we must work together to defend multilateralism and resist inward-looking protectionist policies.\nGiven the confluence of crises that we are facing today \u2013 from the triple planetary crisis relating to climate, food, and water, to technological disruptions such as AI (Artificial intelligence) \u2013 the window for action is narrowing and we must seize on the opportunity of the Summit to do so. We are glad to see that an important first step has been taken with Member States agreeing on the scope of the \u2018Pact of the Future\u2019, to be adopted at the Summit. Allow me to briefly share Singapore\u2019s thoughts on key issues as we collectively develop this \u2018Pact\u2019 over the next year.\nFirst, on sustainable development and financing for development. This year\u2019s SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Summit underscored the worrying message that the world is behind in the implementation of SDGs. Building on the Summit\u2019s outcomes, we need to develop action-oriented strategies which stakeholders can consider and work together to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda. If we do not urgently address the widening development gap, this could also undermine the global solidarity that we need to tackle other planetary challenges like climate change.\nSecond, on international peace and security. A strong multilateral framework for peace and security issues has to keep pace with the times and be equipped to respond to realities in the current geopolitical and security environment, especially emerging challenges such as AI, cyber, and outer space. We need to redouble efforts to develop norms and rules for these areas to keep up with the rapid technological changes. It is critical that the framework continues to be underpinned by a strong adherence to international law and the UN Charter, based on fundamental principles such as respect for political independence and sovereignty.\nThird, on science, technology and innovation, and digital cooperation. Singapore supports the development of a substantive Global Digital Compact which will provide a roadmap to guide how we can maximise the opportunities and address the challenges of digital transformation. Our efforts should be guided by three broad principles. It should encourage digital inclusion, promote innovation, and enhance interoperability, or the three \u2018I\u2019s. We should also aim towards an action-oriented Compact that allows us to harness the diversity of policies around the world. It should also provide concrete ideas on how we can use technologies such as AI to achieve SDGs, while promoting accountability, trust and confidence by instituting safeguards and governance tools.\nLastly, on transforming global governance. We need to revitalise the international financial architecture. The Bretton Woods institutions which were formed after the Second World War were not designed to deal with the multiple new challenges that we face today. We should update and expand the mandates of international financial institutions and multilateral development banks to include the financing of global public goods and the protection of the global commons. We should ensure fair and equitable global access to these global public goods, especially for developing countries in times of crisis. Toward this end, IFIs (International Financial Institutions) should work with the UN to define a core set of global public goods that would benefit from enhanced and predictable global public investment.\nIt is also critical that we strengthen the UN\u2019s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to new and evolving global shocks, given how quickly ripple effects take place today as we have seen in the past few years. A successful Pact for the Future is one that must benefit not just our peoples now, but give hope to future generations.\nI call on all Member States to work together to achieve substantive, actionable outcomes at the Summit next year. Singapore stands ready to contribute constructively to this process.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nPhoto Caption: Minister, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman delivers Singapore\u2019s National Statement at the Preparatory Ministerial Meeting of the Summit of the Future, 21 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

        "content": "Christiane Amanpour (CNN): Now, Singapore and its Southeast Asian neighbours navigate a tricky middle ground in a very tense relationship between China and the United States. Dr Vivian Balakrishnan is the Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs and he is joining me now.\nTell me about this then. Neither (President) Xi Jinping nor the other Permanent Five Members are here, except for President (Joe) Biden. How much are you feeling the pressure in your Indo Pacific region as this sort of tempo escalates between the two powers?\nMinister: First thing you need to understand (is) Singapore is a tiny city state \u2013 multiracial, multilingual - in the heart of Southeast Asia. We feel this troubled world in a very real sense. The war in Europe is still going on. There is food and energy insecurity, climate change, the digital revolution, the promise and the risk of AI (Artificial Intelligence) \u2013 all these things are happening. Now more than ever before, we need global leadership. The problems are beyond that of just the United States or China or Europe. In fact, you need the whole world together. What we are seeing here at the UN (United Nations) now is an organisation that is showing it is capable of walking and chewing gum. That is why you have got to deal with all these crises.\nAmanpour: Even without the big leaders?\nMinister: Even without the big leaders, but their teams are here. We live in a day and age (where) you can transmit messages live.\nAmanpour: Okay. Do you believe some of the conversation around how the Russian illegal war against Ukraine is kind of sucking the oxygen out of many, many other important issues?\nMinister: I think that was the fear last year. This year, particularly if you look at what has happened in the last three days, it is part of the theme. It has not gone away. It is a direct frontal assault on the UN Charter, a risk to small city states like us. Territorial integrity is sacred, but the litany of other problems \u2013 the fact that we are behind time in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the fact that we are not meeting the Paris Agreement commitments, the fact that climate change with extreme weather events is a clear and present danger, all that is on the foreground too.\nAmanpour: For you particularly they say, you are one of the fastest heating, urban, I mean, you are a city state.\nMinister: We are a city state, an island \u2013\nAmanpour: But it is hot.\nMinister: One degree north of the equator. We could not stand here at midday in Singapore without being completely drenched. So, a world which is hotter is a world which is hostile to a place like mine.\nAmanpourTell me how you navigate what I described as a rather tricky bridge between East and West at this particular time in the Indo Pacific.\nMinister: First point. We have got great relations with the United States and with China. It is not just a form of words. The United States is the biggest foreign investor in Singapore, (and) also the biggest service trading partner in Singapore. China is our biggest trading partner for goods. We are a significant investor in China as we have also investments in the United States. For us, the best possible world is one in which the two big boys get along.\nAmanpour: And how will they get along?\nMinister: That is not something you and I can wish on or impose on President Biden or President Xi. But let me just say, for someone who has been there, interacted with them \u2013 neither side is actually spoiling for war. But the fundamental problem is the lack of strategic trust. What that means is both sides have to assume the worst of each other. They have got to take precautions, and that precaution is viewed as a potential threat, and you take a counter precaution. The danger is an escalatory spiral. Our recommendation is there needs to be a lot more direct face-to-face interaction. There is no substitute (for) eyeball to eyeball, handshake to handshake, and having honest to goodness conversations.\nAmanpour: This apparently is going to happen at the important meeting in San Francisco.\nMinister: I hope so.\nAmanpour: What are your hopes for that?\nMinister: That they meet, that they engage \u2013\nAmanpour: What is the best that could happen out of that?\nMinister: The beginning of a real strategic conversation. If you go back four decades, you had the Soviet Union, you had the United States of America. As far as nuclear arms were concerned, they were peer powers. There was strategic restraint, there was deterrence. You could have conversations about arms limitation. Today, because the situation is still evolving so rapidly, neither side has really sized each other up and said, \u201cLook, guys, we better put some guardrails, and not guardrails in a negative, aggressive sense, but guardrails around both of us, so we do not lose the plot.\u201d Now, that can only happen if they meet, interact, generate some strategic trust and then get to do a few things together. There is a lot to do together; the pandemic, climate change, AI \u2013 do we need regulations? What about the SDGs? Can that be done without the United States and China? The answer is no.\nAmanpourAnd yet, there seems to be a hardening of the political structure in China, and most certainly the President is under very strong political pressure to sound tough on China. I want to ask you, how seriously does your Government take reports that China is trying to influence ethnic Chinese populations across Southeast Asia, including in your country, your city state? Former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry says, \u201cIf too many Chinese Singaporeans are foolish enough to subscribe to Xi's version of the China dream, the multiracial social cohesion that is the foundation of Singapore's success will be destroyed. Once destroyed, it cannot be put together again.\u201d\nMinister: Let me put it to you this way. Singapore is a young city state, multiracial (and) multilingual. We are not Chinese, we are not Indians, we are not Malays, we are certainly not Americans. I am confident that there is a very strong sense of a Singapore identity. We may speak different languages, have different colours. But if you come to Singapore, and I hope you do \u2013\nAmanpour: I have been.\nMinister: You will realise there is a strong sense of identity.\nThe next point is, we do not look at the world in binary terms. Cultural pride, linguistic proficiency, being able to understand and to appreciate opportunities, both in the West and East, in India and in Europe, is a strategic advantage for us. The fact that we understand and therefore some people may think they have opportunities to influence us, that is baked into our cultural DNA.\nAmanpour: So, you have detected it and you are deterring it?\nMinister: It is something which we need to be aware of. It is something which we take appropriate precautions on. But my fundamental point is this \u2013 I trust Singaporeans. We know our identity and most importantly, we understand what our long-term national interests are. It is not to be anybody's vassal state or proxy. The way we navigate this nexus between the United States and China is to be straight with both of them.\nWe tell them we have our own long-term national interests. Both of you are critical to our long-term national interests. I do not have the luxury of saying sweet nothings in Beijing and sweet nothings in Washington. We play a constructive, honest broker role.\nAmanpour: Can I ask you a human rights question?\nMinister: Yes.\nAmanpour: Amnesty International has noted the resumption of executions in your country for non-violent crimes like drug-related offences. Last year, major criticism after the execution of a Malaysian man with a very, very, very low IQ, according to his lawyers. Five women, first woman in twenty years executed in the summer. Why?\nMinister: We are extremely draconian for drug trafficking.\nAmanpour: Even for somebody who is barely at 69 IQ?\nMinister: It gives me no joy for every case that is executed for drug trafficking.\nEven in the United States, the drug problem is real.\nSecond point. If you look in my neighbourhood, that is where the stuff is grown, is processed.\nThird point. Singapore is a place where our trading volume is three times our GDP. Can you imagine, if we did not take a strong stand on drug trafficking, we would be a nexus \u2013 the process in which it would reach even your shores.\nSo, I take no joy in this, but I am just making the point that we take a very, very harsh position on this.\nAmanpour: I am glad to have you on the record on this. Foreign Minister, thank you very much indeed. Appreciate you being with us.\nMinister: You must come to Singapore again.\nAmanpour: Will do. Thank you."

In addition, the 3G welcomes the commitment of the G20 to, inter alia, accelerate strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, and the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, pursue low-global greenhouse gas (GHG)/low-carbon emissions, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable development pathways by championing an integrated and inclusive approach, scale up financing for development, pursue multilateral reforms, in particular, of the international financial institutions, strengthen the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to address global challenges to maximise developmental impact, and improve access to digital services and digital public infrastructure and leverage digital transformation opportunities to boost sustainable and inclusive growth.The 3G noted the G20\u2019s assessment that cascading crises have posed challenges to long-term growth and hence, appreciates the G20\u2019s decision to implement well-calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies to help resolve the cost-of-living crisis and unlock strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.The 3G further welcomed the G20\u2019s recognition of the critical role of private enterprise in accelerating growth and driving sustainable economic transformations, and to this end, the G20 will, inter alia, create inclusive, sustainable, and resilient global value chains and support developing countries to move up the value chain. The 3G agrees with the G20 that start-ups and MSMEs are natural engines of growth. The 3G strongly supports the G20\u2019s commitment to ensure a level-playing field and fair competition by discouraging protectionism and market-distorting practices. It agrees with the G20\u2019s reiteration of the need to pursue WTO reform to improve all its functions through an inclusive member-driven process, as well as its emphasis on the need for a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024, with the objective of achieving an open, predictable, rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. 3G members will work with the G20 to make MC13 a success.The 3G Ministers commended India for its leadership and its commitment to inclusive, equitable, high-quality education and skills training for all, including for those in vulnerable situations; and its recognition of the importance of investment in supporting human capital development.The 3G agreed with the G20 that we should urgently accelerate our actions to address environmental crises and challenges including climate change, which disproportionately impact developing countries, especially Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. Hence, the 3G supports the G20\u2019s reaffirmation of its steadfast commitments to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation ofParis Agreement and its temperature goal.The 3G Ministers noted that the rules-based multilateral system is under stress amidst rising geopolitical tensions and increasing protectionism. The 3G Ministers reiterated the importance of upholding the principles of international law and human rights, as contained in the United Nations (UN) Charter, as well as in ensuring that the multilateral system remain open and rules-based.The 3G Ministers appreciated the G20\u2019s inclusive approach and continued engagement of non-G20 members, such as the 3G, to encourage stronger dialogue between the G20 and the broader UN membership and taking into consideration a wider perspective of views. The 3G Ministers thanked Indonesia for its assessment of the way forward in addressing global challenges, and Brazil for briefing the meeting on its priorities. The 3G looked forward to Brazil\u2019s Presidency next year and to working with Brazil to explore further collaboration between the G20 and the 3G, in particular, to assist developing countries in accelerating the progress towards the SDGs. The 3G Ministers highlighted that it is important to ensure inclusiveness, coherence and complementarity when setting global standards and mobilising collective action on shared challenges. 20 September 2023\nThe 16th Ministerial Meeting of the Global Governance Group (3G)[1] was convened in New York on 20 September 2023 on the sidelines of the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The Troika of the Group of Twenty (G20) (previous, current and incoming Presidencies), as represented by Indonesia, India, and Brazil respectively this year, was invited to join the 3G Foreign Ministers to explore how the 3G and the G20 could work together to address challenges facing the international community.

        "content": "Minister: Good afternoon everyone. I am delighted to join you at the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. You have just heard from Jacinda Ardern who says she comes from a small country. We are even smaller. We are 5.8 million people, but Singapore will fit into Lake Taupo, in North Island of New Zealand. That is how small we are.\nThe theme of this segment \u201cRevive our Oceans\u201d is a special and very apt one for me and my people from this small maritime city state called Singapore. Our history, our people, our economy are inseparable from the waters around us. The other point you need to know is that in the case of Singapore, our trading volume is three times our GDP. I dare say no one else in this audience has that ratio. So, when we say the sea and the maritime routes are essential, are lifeblood, it is not just a talking point, it is a real thing.\nThe survival and the prosperity of people on islands all over the world are dependent on the vitality of the sea and how we live and make a living. It applies to us because even for those of us who are in the sea, we could also be sea-locked if we do not have access to the sea routes which our trade, prosperity and peace depend on.\nThe ocean provides food, jobs, livelihood, and as I said just now, global trade. The big concern now is the impact of climate change and its impact not just on sea levels, and again, I will need to remind you for Singapore, one quarter of our land has been reclaimed from the sea, which means by definition, it is not very high above sea level. Just based on the current projections, we would face threats. Quite apart from sea level rise, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events \u2013 floods, droughts, and all of the above \u2013 also pose existential threats to island states like mine.\nToday, we also witness the thing which you do not see, the increasing acidification of the sea. That means less oxygen for marine life, and that must ultimately mean less food for human beings as well. Preserving our oceans and maintaining livelihoods is not something that is mutually exclusive. In fact, it is part of a virtuous cycle.\nLet me just highlight three points. First, the global movement towards decarbonisation and digitalisation of the maritime sector. This is a mouthful, but just stop to think about it; decarbonisation and digitalisation of the maritime sector, in fact, is a great opportunity. Shipping emits 1 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. There is much potential for abatement. Green and digital shipping corridors are being set up to be vital nodes in what we hope will be a trailblazing metaphor. But we need to have these corridors to show that it is possible to decarbonise and still be economically viable.\nOne such corridor that is being established is between the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore, the Port of Los Angeles, and the Port of Long Beach, which was established in April 2023, as part of what we call the green shipping challenge that was launched by both the US and Norway last year. Besides supporting the transition to lower and hopefully zero emission fuels by ships, these green and digitally empowered shipping corridors will spur growth opportunities for businesses as they look for opportunities to pilot and to scale low emission technologies for maritime port operations and for trans-oceanic shipping.\nThe second point I want to make is related to international law. The conservation and the sustainable use of our oceans must be conducted under the aegis of international law. In particular, for us, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is paramount. It is, in our view, the ultimate legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. Recently, we achieved a new Treaty. We use the acronym, \u201cBBNJ\u201d which stands for \u201cBiodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction\u201d. This is an agreement under the aegis of UNCLOS, which is a major step forward in the governance of the global commons.\nIt is a historic agreement. It creates rules for the sustainable use of resources in the high seas and the deep seabeds in the areas beyond national jurisdiction. It recognises the common heritage of mankind, and that these resources belong to everyone. We are looking for fair and equitable use of these resources without damaging the oceans and being fair to future generations.\nI am proud that a fellow Singaporean, Ambassador Rena Lee, served as the President of the Intergovernmental Conference that was able to bring the whole world to land at this new Treaty. Given the state of the world that we are confronting today, to be able to arrive at a consensus and to arrive at a Treaty is a significant achievement. This is also a reaffirmation of the relevance of the United Nations and of multilateralism, and a reminder that now more than ever before, we need a rules-based international order \u2013 one that is fair to all countries, big or small, and one that is also fair to the current and future generations of mankind. I am glad that I will be one of the early signatories for the BBNJ Agreement, I hope to sign it tomorrow, and I want to encourage all of you to put pressure on your own politicians to sign on to the BBNJ Agreement as well, not just for the sake of an agreement, but for what it represents.\nMy third and final point is that every country has a role to play. Singapore may be small, but we are doing our part for ocean conservation and for green shipping. Besides setting up these green shipping corridors, we are also sharing our development experience and extending technical assistance to fellow developing countries. Singapore is a proud member of SIDS, Small Island Developing States. We have to seek safety in numbers and raft our futures together. The Singapore Cooperation Programme has conducted over 60 ocean-related courses with more than 1,200 participants from 120 countries and intergovernmental organisations. We will continue to pour resources, bandwidth and attention into this effort.\nLet me conclude. There must be collective commitment and a firm resolve at all levels amongst the public, private and the civic sector, to work together to achieve a more resilient, sustainable and fairer tomorrow. We look forward to hosting the Earthshot Prize Awards on the 7th of November 2023. I hope I will see many of you in Singapore shortly. Thank you all very much.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2018s Remarks at the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit in New York, 19 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

As such, it was essential that the right safeguards were put in place to ensure privacy and transparency, and to build trust and confidence in the responsible development and deployment of AI. On the issue of developing a multilateral, global framework for AI governance, Minister Balakrishnan underscored the need to include diverse viewpoints and advocated for multi-stakeholder engagement involving the commitment of governments, industry, and civil society. Minister Balakrishnan also shared Singapore\u2019s experiences in developing an AI governance testing framework, AI Verify, as well as the launch of the AI Verify Foundation to bring the private sector and industry on board to develop better standards and practices in the use of AI.\nThe transcript of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s remarks is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n19 SEPTEMBER 2023\nTRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S REMARKS AT THE US\u2019 SIDE EVENT ON \u201cARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ACCELERATING PROGRESS ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\u201d, 18 SEPTEMBER 2023, NEW YORK\nGood afternoon everyone, it is a pleasure to be here.\nSingapore is a tiny city state. Our trade volume is three times our GDP, and we only derive global significance by being a critical node in a global network.\nOf course, trade, I have mentioned, the flow of goods and products, but equally, if I ask you now to Google submarine cables in Asia, just look at how many radiate into or out from Singapore. So, I say this so that you understand that my views are quite naturally biased. But I am in favour of openness, in favour of connectivity, and later on I want to emphasise the role of regulation and in particular, trust.\nLet me first start off with the Singapore Government's attitude to AI (Artificial Intellience). The pace of transformation in the last decade is astounding. Since this is UNGA (United Nations General Assembly) week, have you all noticed the quality of translations has improved significantly within the last decade? To some extent, it is because the UN (United Nations) insists on publishing multilingual, authoritative versions, and the combination of deep-learning, machine learning, against this corpus of curated, high-quality data, enabled pattern recognition and therefore, machine learning, translation, and computer systems which could read, see, classify, translate, and we have all witnessed that within the last decade.\nCurrently, the latest craze is large language models and generative AI. But even as we speak, I think this is about to be replaced by what I would consider to be the next level in which AI agents have transactional ability \u2013 which means to take instructions, to interact with other humans, organisations, and even other AI agents to get into financial transactions, to make contracts. This may sound like pie in the sky, but I think we are on the verge of going beyond generative AI into transactional AI.\nNow, before I run ahead of myself, come back to Singapore. Our attitude is, this is a big deal. This is transforming the means of production in the world. For a little place like Singapore to be relevant, we better get on this bandwagon. The first point is that we believe in learning by doing. In other words, we have to practice because we are not going to invent the large language models. We cannot compete with the Silicon Valley. But we can be a vital node which the Silicon Valley needs, even as it spreads its web across the world.\nLet me cite you a few examples where we are actually using AI in Singapore. First, in the Singapore Civil Service today, we are using large language models.\nAnother example. In the eye center, for years, we have been using retinal photographs to predict systemic diseases because it just so happens, the eye is an outgrowth of the brain which is visible and the patterns of the blood vessels, their caliber, the way they cross and exudate, gives us quite a lot of clues about the systemic issues that you have.\nAnother model, in my previous incarnation in the Ministry of Environment, we are using models, AI models, because we are worried about floods, droughts and extreme weather events which we all know are getting worst because we are behind time in reaching the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals).\nAnother example, even for fish farming, because you know, we do not have enough land. Again, optimising the fish farms, for security, for biosafety and for improving yield. The point I am trying to make is that we are just doing this, and if need be, doing it within sandboxes because the only way to get on this bandwagon is to do, and to learn from doing, and to learn from those mistakes. Fail quickly and improve it.\nThe second point is that it is not enough to just get on the bandwagon and do it, but you do need to make sure that safety, privacy, and public acceptability is part of it.\nIn fact, for governments which want to be early adopters, it is critical to have the right safeguards and guidelines in place for the responsible use of AI and demonstrably so, so that people can judge that you are not just experimenting with their data and taking liberties with their data, but you are doing it in order to improve the quality of services provided to the people.\nOne approach in which we wanted to be transparent and take a risk-based approach is that in 2019, Singapore released our own Model AI Governance Framework which provides detailed and readily verifiable implementation guidelines to private sector organisations, and to assure people that key ethical and governance issues are taken into consideration when rolling out these solutions. Last year, we went further to launch an international pilot of what we call AI Verify. This is an AI governance testing framework, a software toolkit to help organisations and governments objectively demonstrate that their systems are behaving responsibly, are based on sensible, accurate data, and to do these tests in a standardised form.\nThe second is that in order to build trust and confidence, we need to ensure that you have wide buy-in and that means, in particular, diverse inputs. And to know that the diversity will pose challenges, but you do need to take into account the diversity in each of our societies in order to arrive at a common approach, based on trust and transparency to the AI frame development. Again, I want to emphasise that it is critical that this not be a purely government venture, but you do need to get the private sector involved. You do need to get civil society and other stakeholders who have real skin in the game as you generate the appropriate regulatory framework.\nThis year, we launched the AI Verify Foundation. This is our attempt to put this principle into practice to develop better frameworks, standards and share best practices. Our current membership stands at more than 60 organisations, including our friends from IBM, and of course Google, or Alphabet, and Microsoft. The point is this is a public-private-civic partnership. I think that kind of multi-stakeholder engagement and approach is essential.\nThird, I just want to end by saying that AI is transformative. It has got great opportunities, but it also has great risks. But these opportunities and risks are issues without a passport, meaning it quickly disseminates and escapes globally.\nBut the impact, both in terms of opportunities and risks, actually have asymmetrical effects on different countries and different societies. The question is, how ready are we when we face this tsunami of impacts, both positive and negative? We believe that we need regional, and we need multilateral, global approaches. At some point, you cannot avoid the question of governance.\nI think we have passed the old paradigm when big tech will say, \u201cdo not worry, trust us\u201d. I think that is not enough. I think you now need regulations. The political dialogue and conversations, both domestically and internationally, will have to occur. Within ASEAN, which is the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, Singapore is working with our neighbours to develop an ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics in order to establish common principles for trustworthy AI and to suggest best practices which we can all learn by doing and sharing.\nLet me just conclude that this is an exciting field. Watch this space. But we do need to expand our minds and understand that just as AI has transformed the scene, the old ways of regulating, cooperating and legislating will not suffice and we do need to break new ground.\nThank you all very much for your attention.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the US\u2019 side event on \u201cArtificial Intelligence (AI) for Accelerating Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d at the sidelines of the 78th United Nations General Assembly, 18 September 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

We stand in solidarity with Morocco and Libya during this difficult time. I am honoured to represent Singapore today at this important meeting convened by the Government of Cuba at the critical halfway point of our collective journey to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nSimultaneous crises ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic, surging food and energy prices, and the planetary threat of climate change have derailed our progress on the SDGs. The multilateral system that we have painstakingly built up over decades is now under severe strain, as we confront the retreat of globalisation, questioning of free trade, and threat of bifurcation of technology and supply chains. The SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General in April this year showed that 30 percent of SDG targets are stagnating or deteriorating.\nWith the SDGs badly off track, it is crucial to mobilise science, technology, and innovation to accelerate action and develop transformative solutions. The benefits can be enormous. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can drive a 7 percent increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period. Food technology, alternative proteins, and smart agriculture may provide the answer to a climate-resilient future. How can we harness the potential of Science, Technology, and Innovation? There are three \u201cI\u201ds to this that I would like to introduce \u2013 Infrastructure, Inclusion, and International Cooperation.\nDigital Public Infrastructure\nFirst, we must build up our Digital Public Infrastructure as the critical backbone to harness the social and economic benefits of technology. This means open, secure, and interoperable digital platforms that can provide public services such as digital cash transfers, online education, or e-health. Research by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) projected that the adoption of financial digital public infrastructure can contribute up to 33 percent of economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Singapore\u2019s adoption of mobile banking and digital payments systems has shown positive results. The Singapore Quick Response Code \u2013 the world\u2019s first unified national e-payment system \u2013 has allowed us to scale up e-payment and create innovative business opportunities. This is a key pillar of SDG 9 on infrastructure, industrialisation, and innovation. Singapore has also developed a National Digital Identity system, called \u201cSingpass\u201d, to enable users to access more than 2,700 digital services securely and conveniently.\nDigital Inclusion\nSecond, we also need to ensure digital inclusion. This requires governments to adopt a human centric approach towards policymaking and work with community partners to strengthen digital access for all. This is why Singapore launched the Digital for Life movement in 2021, which aims to work on ground-up initiatives to help Singaporeans embrace digitalisation. Today, we have a 96.9 percent internet penetration rate amongst all households and all our school children have access to digital devices for their classroom learning.\nWhile we embrace digitalisation, we must also address potential harms. For example, to address online scams, we can use analytic tools to identify and block suspicious websites or allow banking customers to suspend their accounts quickly if they are compromised. Central Banks and Financial Authorities must work closely with financial institutions to protect their citizens and clients. Given the organised and transnational nature of scams, governments must also work closely with each other to maximise the impact of our preventive measures.\nInternational Cooperation\nThis brings me to my third point, on the importance of international cooperation to nurture global digital commons that are open, accessible, and interoperable. This is crucial for developing countries\u2019 technological advancement and economic development. To this end, the Global Digital Compact provides an important platform for Member States to forge common rules and norms that facilitate economic transactions and growth. It could also promote efforts to expand the availability of, and access to digital public goods. On our part, Singapore open-sourced \u2018AI Verify\u2019, an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit that validates the performance of AI systems and is consistent with international AI governance frameworks. We hope that the global community can join us in developing better frameworks, standards, and best practices.\nSingapore is also happy to support the development needs of fellow developing countries through capacity-building under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen participation from close to 150,000 officials from more than 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the past 30 years. We will give greater focus to the digital economy, AI and cybersecurity, and emerging technologies, and work with partners such as the UNDP to support knowledge exchanges among developing countries.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, while Science, Technology, and Innovation can help us accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, it will require: first, infrastructure to support connectivity and interoperability; second, inclusion to ensure that everyone has equal access to the benefits; and third, international cooperation to address potential challenges.\nThank you."

        "content": "Honourable Ministers\nExcellencies\nDistinguished Guests\nLadies and Gentlemen\nWelcome to the 4th Singapore-Sub-Saharan Africa High-Level Ministerial Exchange Visit, or AHLMEV.\nThe AHLMEV was first convened in 2014 to foster friendship and closer dialogue with our friends from Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 29 Ministers and Deputy Ministers participated in the first three iterations of the AHLMEVs, and we are excited to resume it after a pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The theme for this year\u2019s AHLMEV is \u201cSingapore and Africa: Partners in Digitalisation and Sustainability\u201d. We have carefully curated a programme under this theme for both sides to exchange views on our respective development priorities and experiences, as well as to explore potential cooperation. I am pleased to note that we have eight Ministers and Deputy Ministers from Botswana, Ghana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Uganda. Thank you for making time in your busy schedules to be with us, and I hope that you will find the programme meaningful.\nAfrica is a continent with much promise. It is rapidly urbanising at an average annual rate of 3.2%, and has a population of more than 1 billion, 70% of whom are under the age of 30. Economic integration efforts through the African Continental Free Trade Area will only supercharge the region\u2019s growth. Southeast Asia is also a large, young, fast growing, urbanising, and digitalising region. ASEAN is expected to grow at a rate of 4.6% this year, above the global average of 3.1%. ASEAN\u2019s combined GDP is at US$ 3 trillion and is set to double within the next two decades. If we succeed, then ASEAN as a whole will become the fourth largest economy in the world. We are also pursuing opportunities in forward-looking areas such as the digital and green economies.\nHowever, ASEAN\u2019s trade in goods with Africa is only about 2.2% of its total trade with the world. There is much untapped potential. Our economies, companies, and investors must look further afield for opportunities. I am encouraged to hear that many companies from both regions are participating in the Africa Singapore Business Forum, which is taking place concurrently with the AHLMEV. At the government level, we can support businesses by creating a business-friendly environment comprising more physical, economic, financial, and digital linkages between both sides. For instance, we could negotiate more economic agreements including Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements and Bilateral Investment Treaties. There is also a need to increase connectivity between our two regions. Currently, there are few direct flights between Singapore and Sub-Saharan Africa, and these are mainly from Johannesburg and Addis Ababa. It is important to encourage more air connectivity both to unlock our economic potential and to spur people-to-people linkages.\nBeyond economic ties, our political exchanges are also important. In the past decade, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has made over 43 high-level visits to Sub-Saharan African countries. I fondly recall my visits to Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia, and South Africa. Post-COVID-19, Prime Minister Lee made his first Official Visit to Rwanda last year, and South Africa and Kenya this year. Rwandan President Paul Kagame and South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor visited Singapore last year too. These visits build upon countless other high-level exchanges, study visits, and trade missions between both sides. We must continue to build on this momentum, both at the regional and bilateral levels.\nA key pillar to our cooperation with many Sub-Saharan Africa countries is in the technical and skills domain. Over 13,000 African officials have participated in capacity-building programmes under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, or SCP. This spans areas from education to sustainable development, urban planning, and logistics. We certainly have a shared belief in the importance of building human capital. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the SCP last year, Prime Minister Lee launched the Singapore-Africa Partnership Package, or SAPP. This offers African officials customised training programmes, priority placement in SCP courses, and postgraduate scholarships in Singapore universities. We are honoured to have a long history of exchanging experiences and best practices with you. We encourage your countries to continue making use of the SCP and SAPP for mutual benefit.\nYour Excellencies,\nWe live in challenging times. The current global situation, both strategic and economic, is graver than what we have experienced for a very long time. It is tempting for countries to turn inwards, and away from mutual trust and respect. But there is much that we can do together \u2013 and much that we must do together \u2013 to address our shared challenges, grow our economies, and uplift the lives of our citizens. Singapore is happy that our ties with our African friends have remained steadfast. We look forward to advancing these partnerships in the years to come.\nThank you for being here. Thank you for joining us, and I look forward to exchanging views with each of you over lunch."

They welcomed the offshore wind site survey permit approval by Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment for a cross-border electricity trading proposal by a consortium comprising Sembcorp Utilities Pte Ltd and PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation. The survey will determine the potential of offshore wind energy in an area of about 200,000 hectares, for potential export from Vietnam to Singapore. A letter of intent was also given to the consortium by Singapore\u2019s Energy Market Authority (EMA) to signal Singapore\u2019s support for this project. They agreed that all parties should continue working together towards the award of a conditional approval by EMA for this proposal.\nTo support the aspirations of both countries to grow and deepen linkages between our innovation ecosystems, the two Leaders witnessed the signing of an MOU on the Singapore-Vietnam Innovation Talent Exchange (ITX) Programme between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which will allow professionals to seek working stints and gain skills and experience in the area of innovation in each other\u2019s economies.\nBuilding upon a longstanding collaboration on human resource and skills development, PM Lee and PM Chinh witnessed the signing of (a) the MOU between Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Manpower and Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs on Skills Development and to promote knowledge exchanges and share best practices on skills development and labour, as the demands of the global economy evolves; (b) the renewed MOU on Educational Cooperation between Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Education and Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Education and Training which will facilitate more educational linkages and professional exchanges; and (c) the renewed MOU on the Study Visit Programme and Executive Education Programme for Senior Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Officials from the period of 2024 to 2026 between Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CPV Commission for External Relations.\nPM Lee separately met CPV General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, President Vo Van Thuong and Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong Dinh Hue in the afternoon. PM Lee had productive discussions with the Vietnamese leaders, reaffirming the close and excellent ties between Singapore and Vietnam, exploring ways to deepen cooperation at bilateral and multilateral levels, and discussing regional and international developments of mutual interest. PM Lee welcomed the Vietnamese leaders to visit Singapore to further advance our relations. PM Lee also laid a wreath at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum earlier in the morning.\nPM Chinh and his spouse Madam Le Thi Bich Tran will host an Official Dinner in honour of PM Lee and Mrs Lee this evening.

        "content": "President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta: Today\u2019s special guest of the President Horta Show for those of you in Timor-Leste and throughout the world \u2014 in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, China, Portugal, the UK, Northern Ireland, Brazil \u2014 the many Timorese, thousands of them, some studying and some earning a living around the world. Today we have a special guest, the Foreign Minister of Singapore, who has been kind enough to spend a few days with us to better understand the reality and needs of our country and our people, and to continue the great relationship we have developed with Singapore since 1999. In 1999, Singapore participated in the International Force East Timor (INTERFET) security mission to securitise, to pacify the situation in Timor-Leste. Ever since, Singapore has stayed with us. 800 Timorese officials have benefitted from a capacity-building programme in Singapore, and we have many other aspects of this multi-faceted relationship.Today, we are going to hear from the Foreign Minister of Singapore. I start with a first question. Obviously, we have to start with a first question. What a silly thing for me to say. The first question for me to say is\u2014 you were a famous, successful eye surgeon, and you transitioned to be a foreign minister. Tell us about this. I know you have been through many portfolios and (there is) nothing extraordinary that a medical doctor becomes a politician, or whatever, there being many cases like that in the world. I do not want to make any comparisons, but even Che Guevara, who was a psychiatrist or medical doctor, became one of the most famous revolutionaries in the world. So firstly, on a personal note, how is a famous eye surgeon who would be operating in an operating room in a famous Singapore hospital sitting here in Timor-Leste as the Foreign Minister of Singapore?Minister Vivian Balakrishnan: Before the personal journey, I should say the reason I am here is because Singapore and Singaporeans deeply admire the people of Timor-Leste. Let me explain this in all sincerity. The circumstances in which Timor-Leste achieved independence were far more difficult than what we went through in Singapore. We admire your bravery, your courage, your determination, and your grit against all odds for so many years to continue to believe that Timor-Leste should be independent, should be sovereign, and should be in a position to make your own decisions for the young children in the audience. I just want to say, I am here first to salute all of you with deep respect.The second point I would make is that Singapore is smaller than Timor-Leste. We are twenty times smaller in land. We have a few more people than you, but the key lesson that we have learnt in our 58 years of independence for Singapore is that it starts with the people. Your people\u2019s hearts, their minds, their health, their willingness to work\u2014 to work hard, to work together to remain united. What you see in Singapore is a very small island, a city state with no natural resources, unlike Timor-Leste. You have oil and gas. You used to have sandalwood. You have land, you have sunshine, you have beautiful oceans. Singapore has much less of that. I once asked my first Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 we looked upon the city of Singapore and I said, \u201cHow does it make you feel?\u201d His answer: \u201cA hardworking and disciplined people built all this.\u201d A simple answer \u2013 hardworking and disciplined people. To lead hardworking and disciplined people, you need leaders like you, and Prime Minister Xanana (Gusm\u00e3o) who fought for independence. But more than that, also to have in your heart the welfare of the people. At this stage now, when I look at Timor-Leste, I can see that you are also bringing up a new generation of children, and you are also bringing up a new generation of leaders.One of the most important challenges for the founding leaders like what you represent is the next generation of leaders, which then answers your first question. In Singapore, we have no professional politicians. Every minister from Singapore has done something else earlier in life. Whether it was an engineer or a surgeon, or a mathematician \u2013 my Prime Minister was a mathematician \u2013 an army officer, a civil servant; it does not matter where, but everyone has had a life. The onus is on the senior leaders to recruit the next generation. That was how I came in. In that sense it is not unusual that every minister from Singapore you meet has had a life before and had nothing to do with politics. But we have to learn the character spirit, and determination of the founding generation. I see a similar process happening here. Coming here, it is exciting to see all the young people, to see the hope and determination which the senior leaders have, and to see the younger generation of leaders. I am here and I am spending several days because I want to meet the people and the leaders of Timor-Leste.President: The question is, as you stated, Singapore is smaller than Timor-Leste by several times.Minister: 20 times.President: And 20 times larger population.MinisterOur population? Maybe about four times (larger).PresidentFour times larger population. But with no oil, no gas, no gold. And yet, today, 40 years more or less after independence, you have achieved what is the envy and admiration of the whole world to be one of the best performing economies. What is the secret? What would be the shortcut for Timor-Leste to be like Singapore? What would be some words of wisdom on your part? You mentioned only two. Hardworking people and discipline. Some of us are hardworking, but most of us, not very disciplined. We are missing at least one. So please, advise us.Minister: Every country is different; every people is different \u2013 your history is different. As I said, you have had a much more difficult history. It is like delivering a baby, but a very difficult birth. It is not fair to compare the circumstances which you are in now and the circumstances in Singapore. I mean that in all sincerity. This has been a very difficult baby to deliver. But the baby is born, and the baby is well, and you want to give hope. I do believe you need hardworking, disciplined people; you need healthy people. That is why the programme which you (President) shared with me yesterday on what you are doing to overcome malnutrition, to enhance the thinking power and brain power of the next generation\u2014the children of Timor-Leste. I think that is so very critical. Because the future is in their minds, in their hands. We must make sure they can grow up well and strong and healthy. And then, education.President: Building on that, can you elaborate on how to prevent (being) stunt(ed), how to rescue our children from (being) stunt(ed) and from extreme malnutrition?Minister: Number one, look after the women. The health of the next generation begins even before the next conception in the womb. Nutrition, healthcare, and education for women. Number two, during pregnancy and even before birth, there should be at least one, two or maybe even three check-ups, before the baby is born. The purpose of those antenatal check-ups is so that you can identify which mother and which child needs assistance during delivery and immediately after delivery. Timor-Leste is a big country. You do not have enough doctors to deliver every baby. Midwives can do it, but you must try to identify beforehand who may need greater assistance. If you can do that, you can immediately rescue more babies. The infant mortality rate in Timor-Leste is still too high. After delivery, the most important item is breastmilk. In Singapore, we are very strict even on advertisements by formula milk companies that they cannot overstate their claims. They cannot make claims that are not backed up by medical science. It is important to understand that the first two years of a child\u2019s life is when the brain is developing the fastest. For children from the ages of two to six (years old), before school starts \u2013 actually, in this modern digital economy, you cannot wait until the age of seven to start school. Basic literacy, language, mental stimulation needs to begin. In Singapore, we are now also paying particular attention to early childhood education.Commercial Break -President: We resume the Horta show with our special guest, Dr Vivian, Foreign Minister of Singapore, who I would say probably from my recollection, (among) the foreign minister(s) who (have visited) us and stay(ed) the longest. He did not come (for) one afternoon and leave the next day; he did not come in the morning and leave by lunchtime. He invested the time to really understand, and it shows that Singapore cares about Timor-Leste and we are very touched and grateful.Maybe moving on from breastfeeding and malnutrition to the future of the countries, where we move to the current situation and the next weeks, months and years to come. Obviously, we know education and health, (which) Minister has shared with us. Tell me \u2013 you know about leadership; Singapore has provided some of the greatest lessons of leadership. I personally have read a lot about the beginnings of Singapore. I have read countless books and (watched) videos on the late, great and respected Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. What does it take for a country to create peace, stability and prosperity?Minister: You need unity. Unity amongst the leaders, unity amongst the people.President: Unity.Minister: Otherwise, too much energy is spent fighting each other. President, I have met you several times in the earlier years, I have met Prime Minister Xanana (Gusm\u00e3o) also maybe 15 years ago, and repeatedly since. I have also met the leaders from the previous government that just changed.I think Timor-Leste is now at a historic moment when you can create that unity amongst the people and the leaders. This is a moment when you have started on the journey to become a member of ASEAN, this is a moment when you have settled your earlier territorial questions with Australia. I hope you will also settle the questions with Indonesia soon. I think this is a historic moment in which Timor-Leste can take off and achieve your full potential. Even for your economy, the decisions that you are going to make in the next five years will affect the next 50 years. What are you going to do with your oil and gas, and the downstream economy? What are you going to do with your land to feed your own people, because you have the capability and the land to be self-sufficient, and to export food. Food is going to become a very vital ingredient in the next few decades.As the world moves into a digital economy, educating our young people in how to use these new tools, and being prepared for the new jobs that are emerging with artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, global supply chains, digital and efficient distribution of goods, ideas, capital and value. We have to urgently prepare the next generation for that kind of world. So many things need to be done now.President: Thank you, Minister for these insights. Explain in simple, layman\u2019s terms, what is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?Minister: It means that machines can now see, hear, understand your words, translate, express, and summarise. It can do many things which human beings used to do, but it will not replace human beings. We will still need musicians, we will still need a band; but the way that music will be transmitted, who will listen to you and how you receive your payments for your talent \u2013 all that will change. There are new tools which we must learn to use, otherwise our old jobs will be devalued.President: Minister, some concrete examples. Where and how is Singapore already using AI? Minister: Within my Ministry, we are using it to help summarise reports, to prepare drafts, to look for data, to look for trends, and to look for patterns. Sometime even (for) my speeches, I try to use (AI to) shorten them. It is still no replacement, because I do not think people really want to hear just a robot speaking. They want to hear you, but all of us, we can improve what we currently do by using intelligent tools. President: One question \u2013 you have, over the years, a country building 10,000 pieces of law and probably the ones from the 1950s and 1960s overlapping and contradicting. What can AI do with this?Minister: It can quickly identify the patterns \u2013 which parts are contradictory, which parts need a political decision, which parts need to be updated. All of Singapore\u2019s laws are available on the internet, easily searched. We know when the law was passed, when it was amended, we know why it was amended. When we look in future at new laws, how will this new law fit with the old laws?Timor-Leste has a more complicated challenge than we have, because you have Portuguese law, and then during the period of occupation there was another layer of law. Now that you have restored your independence, your circumstances are far more complicated. But I think this process can be assisted with these new tools. When the Timorese officials come to Singapore, we will show them how we use the tools, they will learn, and they will bring it back and apply it in your own way.Another example \u2013 because you use many languages \u2013 nowadays, the translation systems are quite good, and they have become much better in the last five years. Whether you want to write a poem in Tetum or Portuguese, or in English, it can help you as well. (AI can also help with) music, photographs, videos. Children will be the best (at using AI), because they will invent things that you and I cannot even imagine yet.President: My questions in the remaining few minutes of our conversation: First, after a few days here, what are your impressions of this country, of our people and where we are? Second, what are some hard-hitting recommendations to us as government, leaders \u2013 a few you have already shared. Third, a message for our people in Timor-Leste and around the world.Minister: After three days here, I am more hopeful in the future of Timor-Leste. Why am I more hopeful? I have met people, I have met the President, the Prime Minister, Ministers, officials, Timorese \u2013 some educated overseas, as smart and as qualified as anybody else. I now see a political leadership which I think is trying to unify the leaders and the people. I now see that you are thinking long-term, planning long-term strategies \u2013 but at the same time, it is not just highfalutin ideas but practical, real programmes. That is why I highlighted your programme for maternal and child health, and education. Even for your economic advantages, like oil and gas, and natural resources, you are looking at downstream, and therefore trying to create better jobs, higher paying jobs for your people. If Timor-Leste can do all this and do all this quickly, and then take advantage of ASEAN membership to have a larger market for your goods and services, to attract more investments in, and to have a more conducive legal system that will give certainty to foreign investors, I think the next few decades are going to be very exciting years for you.I do not have any hard-hitting things because frankly, from what I have seen, I have been more impressed rather than critical. It is about getting your people united, disciplined, hardworking, working smart, and building the future. Your population has got more young people than any other Asian society. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. If you can equip all of them with education, good health and jobs, this place will flourish. But if young people do not have hope and opportunity, then there will be political challenges in the future. Which way this goes is in your hands, but we admire you, we respect you and we will help you with ASEAN.President: We can help Singapore. How? One way: Singaporean should drink more Timor coffee. Minister: Oh yes, they will. I think all my team and the media have enjoyed your coffee tremendously. But you must export more, produce more, market more. President: Thank you so much, Minister Vivian. Minister: You are most welcome. This is the first time I have ever done a show like this with the President of the country that I am visiting. Thank you for the honour.Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPresident Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta: Today\u2019s special guest of the President Horta Show for those of you in Timor-Leste and throughout the world \u2014 in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, China, Portugal, the UK, Northern Ireland, Brazil \u2014 the many Timorese, thousands of them, some studying and some earning a living around the world.

I am here and I am spending several days because I want to meet the people and the leaders of Timor-Leste.\nPresident: The question is, as you stated, Singapore is smaller than Timor-Leste by several times.\nMinister: 20 times.\nPresident: And 20 times larger population.\nMinisterOur population? Maybe about four times (larger).\nPresidentFour times larger population. But with no oil, no gas, no gold. And yet, today, 40 years more or less after independence, you have achieved what is the envy and admiration of the whole world to be one of the best performing economies. What is the secret? What would be the shortcut for Timor-Leste to be like Singapore? What would be some words of wisdom on your part? You mentioned only two. Hardworking people and discipline. Some of us are hardworking, but most of us, not very disciplined. We are missing at least one. So please, advise us.\nMinister: Every country is different; every people is different \u2013 your history is different. As I said, you have had a much more difficult history. It is like delivering a baby, but a very difficult birth. It is not fair to compare the circumstances which you are in now and the circumstances in Singapore. I mean that in all sincerity. This has been a very difficult baby to deliver. But the baby is born, and the baby is well, and you want to give hope. I do believe you need hardworking, disciplined people; you need healthy people. That is why the programme which you (President) shared with me yesterday on what you are doing to overcome malnutrition, to enhance the thinking power and brain power of the next generation\u2014the children of Timor-Leste. I think that is so very critical. Because the future is in their minds, in their hands. We must make sure they can grow up well and strong and healthy. And then, education.\nPresident: Building on that, can you elaborate on how to prevent (being) stunt(ed), how to rescue our children from (being) stunt(ed) and from extreme malnutrition?\nMinister: Number one, look after the women. The health of the next generation begins even before the next conception in the womb. Nutrition, healthcare, and education for women. Number two, during pregnancy and even before birth, there should be at least one, two or maybe even three check-ups, before the baby is born. The purpose of those antenatal check-ups is so that you can identify which mother and which child needs assistance during delivery and immediately after delivery. Timor-Leste is a big country. You do not have enough doctors to deliver every baby. Midwives can do it, but you must try to identify beforehand who may need greater assistance. If you can do that, you can immediately rescue more babies. The infant mortality rate in Timor-Leste is still too high. After delivery, the most important item is breastmilk. In Singapore, we are very strict even on advertisements by formula milk companies that they cannot overstate their claims. They cannot make claims that are not backed up by medical science. It is important to understand that the first two years of a child\u2019s life is when the brain is developing the fastest. For children from the ages of two to six (years old), before school starts \u2013 actually, in this modern digital economy, you cannot wait until the age of seven to start school. Basic literacy, language, mental stimulation needs to begin. In Singapore, we are now also paying particular attention to early childhood education.\nPresident: We resume the Horta show with our special guest, Dr Vivian, Foreign Minister of Singapore, who I would say probably from my recollection, (among) the foreign minister(s) who (have visited) us and stay(ed) the longest. He did not come (for) one afternoon and leave the next day; he did not come in the morning and leave by lunchtime. He invested the time to really understand, and it shows that Singapore cares about Timor-Leste and we are very touched and grateful.\nMaybe moving on from breastfeeding and malnutrition to the future of the countries, where we move to the current situation and the next weeks, months and years to come. Obviously, we know education and health, (which) Minister has shared with us. Tell me \u2013 you know about leadership; Singapore has provided some of the greatest lessons of leadership. I personally have read a lot about the beginnings of Singapore. I have read countless books and (watched) videos on the late, great and respected Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. What does it take for a country to create peace, stability and prosperity?\nMinister: You need unity. Unity amongst the leaders, unity amongst the people.\nPresident: Unity.\nMinister: Otherwise, too much energy is spent fighting each other. President, I have met you several times in the earlier years, I have met Prime Minister Xanana (Gusm\u00e3o) also maybe 15 years ago, and repeatedly since. I have also met the leaders from the previous government that just changed.\nI think Timor-Leste is now at a historic moment when you can create that unity amongst the people and the leaders. This is a moment when you have started on the journey to become a member of ASEAN, this is a moment when you have settled your earlier territorial questions with Australia. I hope you will also settle the questions with Indonesia soon. I think this is a historic moment in which Timor-Leste can take off and achieve your full potential. Even for your economy, the decisions that you are going to make in the next five years will affect the next 50 years. What are you going to do with your oil and gas, and the downstream economy? What are you going to do with your land to feed your own people, because you have the capability and the land to be self-sufficient, and to export food. Food is going to become a very vital ingredient in the next few decades.\nAs the world moves into a digital economy, educating our young people in how to use these new tools, and being prepared for the new jobs that are emerging with artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, global supply chains, digital and efficient distribution of goods, ideas, capital and value. We have to urgently prepare the next generation for that kind of world. So many things need to be done now.\nPresident: Thank you, Minister for these insights. Explain in simple, layman\u2019s terms, what is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nMinister: It means that machines can now see, hear, understand your words, translate, express, and summarise. It can do many things which human beings used to do, but it will not replace human beings. We will still need musicians, we will still need a band; but the way that music will be transmitted, who will listen to you and how you receive your payments for your talent \u2013 all that will change. There are new tools which we must learn to use, otherwise our old jobs will be devalued.\nPresident: Minister, some concrete examples. Where and how is Singapore already using AI?\nMinister: Within my Ministry, we are using it to help summarise reports, to prepare drafts, to look for data, to look for trends, and to look for patterns. Sometime even (for) my speeches, I try to use (AI to) shorten them. It is still no replacement, because I do not think people really want to hear just a robot speaking. They want to hear you, but all of us, we can improve what we currently do by using intelligent tools.\nPresident: One question \u2013 you have, over the years, a country building 10,000 pieces of law and probably the ones from the 1950s and 1960s overlapping and contradicting. What can AI do with this?\nMinister: It can quickly identify the patterns \u2013 which parts are contradictory, which parts need a political decision, which parts need to be updated. All of Singapore\u2019s laws are available on the internet, easily searched. We know when the law was passed, when it was amended, we know why it was amended. When we look in future at new laws, how will this new law fit with the old laws?\nTimor-Leste has a more complicated challenge than we have, because you have Portuguese law, and then during the period of occupation there was another layer of law. Now that you have restored your independence, your circumstances are far more complicated. But I think this process can be assisted with these new tools. When the Timorese officials come to Singapore, we will show them how we use the tools, they will learn, and they will bring it back and apply it in your own way.\nAnother example \u2013 because you use many languages \u2013 nowadays, the translation systems are quite good, and they have become much better in the last five years. Whether you want to write a poem in Tetum or Portuguese, or in English, it can help you as well. (AI can also help with) music, photographs, videos. Children will be the best (at using AI), because they will invent things that you and I cannot even imagine yet.\nPresident: My questions in the remaining few minutes of our conversation: First, after a few days here, what are your impressions of this country, of our people and where we are? Second, what are some hard-hitting recommendations to us as government, leaders \u2013 a few you have already shared. Third, a message for our people in Timor-Leste and around the world.\nMinister: After three days here, I am more hopeful in the future of Timor-Leste. Why am I more hopeful? I have met people, I have met the President, the Prime Minister, Ministers, officials, Timorese \u2013 some educated overseas, as smart and as qualified as anybody else. I now see a political leadership which I think is trying to unify the leaders and the people. I now see that you are thinking long-term, planning long-term strategies \u2013 but at the same time, it is not just highfalutin ideas but practical, real programmes. That is why I highlighted your programme for maternal and child health, and education. Even for your economic advantages, like oil and gas, and natural resources, you are looking at downstream, and therefore trying to create better jobs, higher paying jobs for your people. If Timor-Leste can do all this and do all this quickly, and then take advantage of ASEAN membership to have a larger market for your goods and services, to attract more investments in, and to have a more conducive legal system that will give certainty to foreign investors, I think the next few decades are going to be very exciting years for you.\nI do not have any hard-hitting things because frankly, from what I have seen, I have been more impressed rather than critical. It is about getting your people united, disciplined, hardworking, working smart, and building the future. Your population has got more young people than any other Asian society. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. If you can equip all of them with education, good health and jobs, this place will flourish. But if young people do not have hope and opportunity, then there will be political challenges in the future. Which way this goes is in your hands, but we admire you, we respect you and we will help you with ASEAN.\nPresident: We can help Singapore. How? One way: Singaporean should drink more Timor coffee.\nMinister: Oh yes, they will. I think all my team and the media have enjoyed your coffee tremendously. But you must export more, produce more, market more.\nPresident: Thank you so much, Minister Vivian.\nMinister: You are most welcome. This is the first time I have ever done a show like this with the President of the country that I am visiting. Thank you for the honour.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Two rare tree species of the Diospyros collection were planted, which will add on to the Gardens\u2019 valuable collection of more than 70 species.\nIn his remarks delivered during the ceremony, Minister Maliki noted that Singapore-Finland relations are characterised by robust economic ties and close collaboration in areas such as education, urban planning, and sustainability. Both countries also boast world-class education systems, with a common commitment to innovation, holistic development, and lifelong learning. In this context, the planting of trees not only symbolises the enduring and flourishing friendship between Singapore and Finland, but also represents the growing people-to-people linkages that underpin the bilateral relationship, serving as platforms for exchanges of knowledge, understanding, experience and culture between Singaporeans and the Finnish people.\nThe event was jointly organised by the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NParks and the Embassy of Finland in Singapore. Minister Maliki was joined by Ambassador of Finland to Singapore His Excellency Antti V\u00e4nsk\u00e4, Non-Resident Ambassador of Singapore to Finland Professor Cheong Koon Hean, Chief Executive Officer of the National Parks Board (NParks) Ms Hwang Yu-Ning, student representatives from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singapore University for Technology and Design (SUTD), and members of the Finnish community in Singapore.\nA similar tree-planting ceremony will take place at Kalasatama Park in Helsinki on 28 August 2023. Singapore will be represented by Honorary Consul-General of Singapore in Helsinki Dr Heikki Ky\u00f6stil\u00e4. These tree-planting events celebrate the strong friendship between Singapore and Finland and underscore both countries\u2019 commitment towards environmental sustainability and conservation.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n23 JULY 2023\nTRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE, SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, AND SECOND MINISTER FOR FO\nREIGN AFFAIRS DR MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S\nREMARKS AT THE TREE PLANTING CEREMONY\nHis Excellency Antti V\u00e4nsk\u00e4, Ambassador of Finland to Singapore,\nProf Cheong Koon Hean, Ambassador of Singapore to Finland,\nMs Hwang Yu-Ning, Chief Executive of NParks,\nDistinguished Guests, ladies and gentlemen.\nI am delighted to join you this morning at the Singapore Botanic Gardens for this tree-planting event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Finland. It is a significant milestone that marks half a century of friendship and cooperation between our two nations.\n2 The act of planting a tree is highly symbolic. We know that it represents hope, resilience, and the promise of a brighter future. Just as these saplings will take root and grow into strong trees one day, I am certain the enduring friendship between Singapore and Finland will continue to develop and flourish.\n3 Over the years, Singapore\u2019s relations with Finland have been characterised by robust economic ties and close collaboration in areas such as education, urban planning, and sustainability. I am planning to visit Finland later in the year to study the Finnish education system, as is a \u201crite of passage\u201d for every Singaporean education minister.\n4 Our bilateral trade continues to grow steadily every year, with Finland being one of Singapore\u2019s key trading and investment partners in the Nordics. As shared by Ambassador V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 earlier, our people-to-people ties are also strong. We have learnt, and will continue to learn, from each other\u2019s world-class education systems, with emphasis on holistic development and life-long learning.\n5 Our institutes of higher learning have established partnerships, and I am glad that we are joined today by students from NUS and SUTD as well as members of the Finnish community in Singapore. Like the network extension of roots that absorb vital nutrients that nourishes trees, our people-to-people linkages serve as important bridges between our two countries, creating platforms for an exchange of knowledge, understanding, experience and culture that buttress the broader bilateral relationship. I would also like to encourage the students here today to continue their exchanges and build strong people-to-people ties.\n6 The Singapore-Finland relationship has come a long way since we first established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1973. Let us also look forward to even stronger and closer ties between our two countries, just as how the trees we are planting today, will blossom and grow. Thank you.\nAbout the Trees Planted\nThe genus Diospyros boasts economically important species, such as the ebony and persimmon. The Diospyros collection is part of Singapore Botanic Gardens\u2019 ex situ collections, aiding conservation and research. The two species below will add on to this valuable assemblage of more than 70 species:\nDiospyros venosa, tree belonging to the Ebenaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, from the Maluku Islands to Myanmar. It provides raw material for handicrafts, traditional medicine and fuel.\nDiospyros filipendula, tree belonging to the Ebenaceae family. It can be found in Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia where it is distributed mainly in tropical rainforest areas.\nAbout Singapore-Finland Relations\nSingapore and Finland established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1973. Our political leaders have had regular exchanges on the sidelines of international fora, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan meeting then-Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto on the sidelines of the 77th United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2022, and on the sidelines of the 2nd Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum in Stockholm, Sweden in May 2023.\nThere are more than 200 Finnish companies in Singapore, including Neste Oil, the world\u2019s largest supplier of renewable diesel, and Nokia. Our education institutes have forged partnerships with Finnish institutes of higher education and with regular exchanges between students of both countries.\nFinland is also a strong supporter of Singapore\u2019s observership at the Arctic Council. We have collaborated with the Finnish Embassy and the Canadian High Commission to organise the \u201cIce in the Tropics\u201d seminar and photo exhibition in November 2017 to raise public awareness on Arctic issues in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\nSingapore is represented by Non-Resident Ambassador to Finland Professor Cheong Koon Hean, and our Honorary Consul-General in Helsinki Dr Karl Heikki Ky\u00f6stil\u00e4.

This is his first visit showing the very positive sign of great cooperation between Timor-Leste and Singapore. We discussed a lot of good things including cooperation ties as well as preparing for Timor-Leste\u2019s accession into ASEAN. Minister Vivian also highlighted the importance of this friendship and has declared to fully support Timor-Leste in capacity building for all officials in the line ministries.\nMinister Vivian Balakrishnan: Thank you. Dadeer di\u2019ak (Good morning). I want to thank my good friend Foreign Minister Freitas for the very warm welcome to this beautiful country.\nI was explaining yesterday, when we flew in, (we saw) the wonderful mountains, blue sea, coastline and really warm, hospitable people. Thank you so much. It is a privilege for me to be here on my first official visit to Timor-Leste. I just realised that it is the 24th day in which the new (Timor-Leste) government has been in office since the very successful Parliamentary Election. I must say, you have been very, very busy. I must have seen you at least four or five times in the last three to four days. So, I can assure the people of Timor-Leste that the new government is working very, very hard.\nWe have had good discussions in these meetings on a whole range of issues, both bilateral as well as multilateral and of course, for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which I know remains a priority for Timor-Leste. It is worth reflecting that our friendship between Singapore and Timor-Leste goes back all the way to the 70s and then later on in 2002, with the restoration of your independence. Singapore was one of the first countries to contribute to peacekeeping operations in Timor-Leste. Over the course of our involvement between 1999 to 2012, the Singapore Armed Forces contributed over 1000 personnel, including medical teams and combat peacekeepers, as well as equipment like landing ship tanks and helicopters. The Singapore Police Force also sent officers to Timor-Leste as part of the UN (United Nations) civilian police contingent - we helped to set up the East Timor police service.\nI have taken some time to go through these points so that you understand that the relationship is an older, established relationship based on friendship and mutual respect. Our ties continue to strengthen and now especially, we are looking into the economic field. Singapore was Timor-Leste\u2019s second largest trading partner and export destination in 2021. Singapore is also a major foreign investor in Timor-Lest - it is a vote of confidence in your country, with companies investing in areas including hospitality and real estate. This reflects Timor-Leste\u2019s very real economic potential, particularly having so many young people who are hungry, ready, dynamic, energetic and ready to go.\nI am also happy to note that direct flights have resumed between Singapore and Dili. In fact, I came on such a flight the day before. This will enhance people-to-people ties as well as strengthen business cooperation. Singapore has been, and will continue to be a strong supporter for Timor-Leste\u2019s development. Over 800 Timorese officials have participated in our Singapore Cooperation Programme in areas like finance, public administration and economic development.\nDuring President Jos\u00e9Ramos-Horta\u2019s State Visit to Singapore last year, we also launched a special technical assistance package, the Singapore-Timor-Leste ASEAN Readiness Support Package, we call it \u2018STARS\u2019. It is customised specifically to support Timor-Leste in its preparation for full ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) membership. Minister Freitas and I also discussed how we can bring our bilateral relations to even greater heights. I can assure you that we are very, very keen to do even more with Timor-Leste.\nToday, I am also pleased to announce that Singapore will establish an embassy in Dili. I have just presented the Third Party Note to you and we will seek your help to find an appropriate location for us to base our embassy. This will be a significant milestone, and it will serve as a focal point for our bilateral cooperation with Timor-Leste. Once again, I want to thank you for your very warm hospitality, for your friendship, and for much, much work ahead for your team and us and rest assured of our fullest support.\nQ&A\nWun Yun Fang (Lianhe Zaobao): Could you share more about the rationale behind setting up an embassy in Timor-Leste now and what is the significance? And could you share more about the timeline for the embassy and would Singapore be appointing a new Ambassador in Timor-Leste?\nMinister Balakrishnan: As I said just now, Timor-Leste is an old friend. They have had difficult circumstances in their birth as a country, as a nation. We admire them, we respect them. Now, as they continue to develop as a country and as a nation, especially as they join ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), we believe this is the time to establish a resident embassy to be the focal point for our cooperation, for our support and for the mutual exploration of opportunities in the future. Robin Hu is our current Non-Resident Ambassador. He will continue in the meantime because he has been doing a lot of good work. He has made a lot of friends and contacts here. In due course, we will have a resident Ambassador, but for now, Robin remains very much in charge. He knows everyone and will continue his hard work. We will have Singaporean diplomats on the ground. Thank you.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on Prime Minister Xanana Gusm\u00e3o in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on Prime Minister Xanana Gusm\u00e3o in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Bendito dos Santos Freitas in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s Joint Press Coference with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Bendito dos Santos Freitas in Dili, 24 July 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

ASEAN\u2019s external partners including the UN, as affirmed by UNSC resolution 2669 of 21 December 2022, have important roles to play in working with ASEAN to uphold the Five-Point Consensus and facilitate national reconciliation in Myanmar. Singapore will continue to support the ASEAN Chair Indonesia and fellow ASEAN Member States to press the Tatmadaw to cease violence and implement the Five-Point Consensus swiftly and fully. The key to peace in Myanmar lies with all Myanmar stakeholders concerned and their willingness to engage in constructive dialogue to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of their people.\nQUESTION\nMr Louis Ng Kok KwangTo ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs what are the results of the most recent humanitarian needs assessment conducted by the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) for Rohingya refugees.\nREPLY\nThe Preliminary Needs Assessment (PNA) conducted in March 2019 was the most recent humanitarian needs assessment.

The ASEAN Secretariat\u2019s Ad-Hoc Support Team was established to monitor the implementation of the PNA. Comprehensive Needs Assessments (CNAs) will be conducted once repatriation commences. However, progress has stalled given the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing political instability in Myanmar and the recent Cyclone Mocha.\nSingapore has strongly supported ASEAN\u2019s efforts and contributed over S$1 million in bilateral aid to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of displaced persons from Rakhine State.

Foreign authorities do not have an obligation to inform the Government when exit bans are issued to Singaporeans.\nQUESTIONS\nMr Vikram Nair:To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether the Government has investigated the allegations in the report by the UN Special Rapporteur claiming that Singapore-based entities had shipped US$254 million worth of supplies to the Myanmar military; (b) if so, what is the update; and (c) whether any actions are being taken.\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how many Singapore-based companies have been identified by the United Nations Special Rapporteur in Myanmar in the sale of dual-use items, raw materials and spare parts for military related uses in Myanmar; (b) what actions have been taken against such companies; and (c) what is the number of such companies against which actions have been taken.\nMr Dennis Tan Lip FongTo ask the Prime Minister in view of the report published on 17 May 2023 by the United Nations Special Rapporteur in Myanmar relating to Singapore companies or Singapore-based entities implicated in the sales of dual-use items, raw materials and spare parts for military related uses (a) how many cases involved Singapore-based banks in the financing of the transactions, including trade financing; and (b) what actions have been taken or are being taken against such banks.\nREPLY\nLet me first make clear that the Singapore Government has not imposed a general trade embargo on Myanmar. We do not want to add to the suffering of Myanmar\u2019s civilian population. In 2022, Singapore\u2019s total bilateral trade with Myanmar was S$5.8 billion. The allegations in the May 2023 report by UN Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Thomas Andrews pertain to supposedly US$254 million worth of goods over a two-year period. Nonetheless, we take Mr Andrews\u2019 report very seriously, and have requested him to provide specific and verifiable evidence to aid our efforts. An initial list of 47 entities were identified. More recently, another 91 entities were identified too. I seek Members\u2019 understanding that this is an interim update as the investigations are ongoing.\nFirst, nine entities are no longer registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, which means that they can no longer carry on business or operate as legal entities in Singapore. This includes entities that were allegedly involved in the transfer of components and spare parts for fighter aircraft, equipment for the Myanmar Navy, as well as radios, research and equipment for electronic warfare.\nSecond, most of the 47 entities no longer have business facilities with Singapore banks. The banks will review the remaining accounts and take appropriate measures, including enhanced scrutiny to ensure that the transactions processed by these entities are not suspicious. Such measures would curtail their ability to continue with any undesirable business.\nAs Myanmar is on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force, financial institutions in Singapore have also been applying enhanced due diligence for Myanmar-linked customers and transactions that present higher risks.\nThird, we are looking into specific details of the alleged US$254 million worth of \u201carms and related goods\u201d that were shipped through Singapore-based entities to the Myanmar military. In Mr Andrews\u2019 report, there were no indications that specific armaments were being transferred to the Myanmar military. Instead, under the category of \u201carms\u201d, what was cited were only spare parts and equipment, without details of what these constituted. The other major categories of items covered in the report included \u201cdual use supplies\u201d which included items such as computers, electrical components, and medical equipment. Another category of items was \u201cmanufacturing equipment\u201d which comprised items like welding machines and overhead cranes; and \u201craw materials\u201d which covered items such as steel beams and aluminium ingots, pipes and valves, and fabric.\nMembers would appreciate from these descriptions that the items do not necessarily constitute \u201carms\u201d or weaponry in its ordinary meaning. Many of them such as computers and medical equipment are also non-controlled items. It is difficult to isolate specific suspicious transactions from such broad categories. We are therefore seeking more details such as export transaction documents to ascertain how these transactions are connected to the manufacture of weapons in Myanmar, so that our checks and investigations can be more thorough, and effective based on objective evidence. At the same time, let me make clear that it is not the Singapore Government\u2019s policy intention to block legitimate trade with Myanmar. Doing so would further set back the country\u2019s development and exacerbate the suffering of the civilian population of Myanmar.\nFinally, I would like to re-state categorically that the Singapore Government has not conducted any military sales to the Myanmar military in recent years, including during the period covered in Mr Andrews\u2019 report \u2013 that is, between February 2021 and December 2022. Indeed, Mr Andrews himself reaffirmed in his report that \u201cthere are no indications the Government of Singapore has approved, or is involved in, the shipment of arms and associated materials to the Myanmar military.\u201d\nWe will continue to work closely and constructively with Mr Andrews to seek specific, verifiable, and where possible court admissible information to advance our investigations.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that the Government remains committed to implementing our policy to prevent the transfer of arms and dual-use items which have been assessed to have potential military application to Myanmar, where there is serious risk that they may be used to inflict violence against unarmed civilians. We will not hesitate to take action against any individual or entity which contravenes this.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 JULY 2023"

It has a nice ring to it. Your Serene Highness, Prince Albert of Monaco, thank you for reminding us that the ship has reached shore. We also thank you for many years of decades of support, being the lighthouse to make sure this ship navigates safely to shore. Thank you, Your Serene Highness.\nI would also like to extend my congratulations to Madam President, and indeed all the delegates here on this historic occasion when we adopt the BBNJ (Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction) Agreement. A historic decision was made today, and it was only possible because of the political commitment of everyone to find a practical solution forward. The world is in an unsettled place, but the world needs good news, and today is a good day. I would also like to add that it is fitting that the adoption of this Agreement comes in the week in which the United Nations will celebrate the International Day of Women in Diplomacy. Many women have played critical roles in the development of this treaty, including in leadership positions. Madam President, as we celebrate the adoption of this treaty, let us take a moment to reflect on and to recognise the significant contributions made by women in diplomacy since the founding of the United Nations. To all the women ambassadors and delegates down here, and to all the women in this room, thank you. Thank you even more so for the future when I am sure we will make this world a better place.\nI want to make just three quick points on this occasion.\nFirst, the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement is a victory for international law. It is fitting that it was adopted not long after the international community celebrated the 40th anniversary of the adoption and opening for signature of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. This is an agreement that is grounded in and upholds UNCLOS through the rules that it sets for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. I believe it strengthens the comprehensive framework provided by UNCLOS and reaffirms the rule of law in ocean governance.\nSecond, the adoption of this Agreement is a victory for the management of the global commons. The ocean provides food, supports millions of jobs, and a livelihood across the entire world, including for landlocked states. We are all dependent on the oceans. It enables global trade and communications, it plays a critical role in climate systems and the water cycle and is a critical reservoir of marine biodiversity. This Agreement is a collective game changer for our efforts to conserve and to sustainably use marine biological diversity. It also marks a step forward for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 that mandates the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, the seas, and the marine resources for all humanity.\nThird, the adoption of this Agreement is a victory for multilateralism, and for the United Nations itself. Singapore is a tiny city state in the heart of Southeast Asia. Our history, our people and our economy are deeply intertwined with the ocean. We rely on the ocean for our survival and our prosperity, and at the same time, we recognise the importance of multilateral cooperation under the aegis of the United Nations in establishing and upholding a rules-based international order founded upon international law. This is especially critical for the survival of small states everywhere. The adoption of this Agreement by consensus, in a time when the world is unsettled, is all the more remarkable. It is a testament of what can be achieved in the United Nations, when we take collective action in pursuit of a shared objective.\nMadam President,\nOn behalf of the government and the people of Singapore, let me say that we feel very privileged and humbled that a Singaporean ambassador was given the honour to preside over the BBNJ negotiations. We express our appreciation to all delegations present for your tireless efforts, your hard work and flexibility, which were critical for the successful conclusion of these negotiations. I also want to thank the UN Secretariat, in particular the Secretary-General of the Conference, Mr Miguel de Serpa Soares, and DOALOS (Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea), which provided invaluable support and assurance to the President and delegations throughout the negotiations and the many sleepless nights which I know you all endured.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the observers, many of you seated at the back (of the room). Your presence is noted and deeply appreciated. To the inter-government organisations and civil society organisations, you have been a constant presence on this journey towards concluding this Agreement. You have every right to take credit for and responsibility for the conclusion of these negotiations by your active participation in the sessions of the conference as observer delegations. The initiatives launched by the civil society organisations and other observers have also contributed to maintaining the momentum, and to keep the political pressure which has led to this successful outcome.\nLet me conclude that today is a critical moment, but our work is not yet done. The international community must now strive for universal participation in and effective implementation of the Agreement. Singapore will sign the Agreement when it opens for signature on the 20th of September 2023, and we intend to ratify it as soon as possible. Just to remind you, you have got the little octopus, and the flag saying, \u201cplease ratify now\u201d. On that note, let me again, call on all UN member states to similarly strive for an early signing and ratification of the treaty, and to share your experiences in ratification with other states so that we can work for its entry into force in the near future as soon as possible.\nThank you all again, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.\nTRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nDR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S OPENING REMARKS AT THE RECEPTION TO CELEBRATE THE ADOPTION OF THE BBNJ AGREEMENT\n19 JUNE 2023\nThank you, Burhan. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be here.\nI wanted to again say how delighted all of us are to be here at the adoption of the BBNJ (Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction) Agreement, which has been a culmination of many years of work by many people in this room. For those of you who have been involved in these sorts of negotiations, I said earlier (that) the world needs some good news. The fact that we were able, despite all the challenges and the zeitgeist moment to arrive safely - I think his Serene Highness said the ship has reached the shore. That is worth celebrating in a big way.\nI also made the point that this Agreement comes in the week in which we are celebrating the International Day of Women in Diplomacy. In case you think it is just words, just look around the room, and you will agree that women in diplomacy have made a real difference. Not just today, not just for this agreement, but indeed, over decades in the United Nations. The fact that we were able to put up Ambassador Rena (Lee), it is another advertisement and icon for women in diplomacy. So, congratulations Rena.\nFor many of my old friends here, like (Maldivian Foreign Minister) Abdulla Shahid, comes literally from a small island state. I would say the difference between Singapore and Maldives is that Maldives has over one million square kilometres of ocean. Now we call it a \u2018Big Ocean State\u2019. Singapore remains a little island city state. The fact that we have been able to make common cause, protect the oceans and the biodiversity that it represents, that it is the cradle of life, that it is also the route by which we all trade, and the fact that it plays such an integral role for climate change. In fact, it is the buffer. It is probably what stands between us and disaster. In recognition of all these challenges, we are very glad to have arrived at this point.\nI also want to inform all of you that Singapore undertook an additional nine new voluntary commitments in connection with the second UN Ocean Conference last year, including launching three new environmental research projects, and working on a variety of shipping decarbonisation initiatives such as encouraging the transition to environmentally friendly ship fuel. Of course, we continue to share our development experiences and extend technical assistance to our fellow developing countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, including courses on law of the sea, biodiversity management, and environmental conservation. It should not surprise you therefore, that we participated actively and constructively in the negotiations for the BBNJ Agreement. We put up a very strong ambassador who was capable of shepherding everyone in a consensual and in her unique, emollient, but effective way of mobilising. This is a fleet of small boats and super tankers. To drive that kind of fleet to get through safely is not a mean feat. Again, a big congratulations to Rena and the team, and to all of you who have made this happen.\nAs I said earlier this morning, our work does not stop here. The Agreement is scheduled to be open for signature on the 20th of September 2023. We hope to see as many of your countries signing that, hopefully on the 20th or soon thereafter, and ratifying it. To the alliance that came up with the mascot of the octopus which says \u201cratify now\u201d, I could not express it better than that.\nThank you all and congratulations. Have a wonderful day.\nTRANSCRIPT OF AMBASSADOR FOR OCEANS AND LAW OF THE SEA ISSUES AND SPECIAL ENVOY OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nRENA LEE\u2019S REMARKS AT THE RECEPTION TO CELEBRATE THE ADOPTION OF THE BBNJ AGREEMENT\n19 JUNE 2023\nI have nothing profound to say, except that I wanted to thank you. Many of you have come up to me to congratulate me. That makes me feel like such a fraud, because it is not me. It is not what I have done. It is what all of you, each and every one of you have done, to bring us to this point. I can only say thank you. It sounds inadequate, but thank you.\nMinister mentioned that this week, we are celebrating the International Day of Women in Diplomacy. People know I do not usually reference my gender, but I wanted to thank all the women who have played such sturdy roles in the process. We should be proud to be women, we should be proud to not have to wear pants or trouser suits, or speak in a lower tone of voice just to get ahead. But let us not forget that for this to work, we need to work with the men too. Men and women alike must join hands in order to move this process forward.\nI know today we are going to celebrate. So, I am not going to take very much longer because all of you want to celebrate, and we should. We should celebrate because while we all recognise that there is a lot more work to be done, I hope that we can take with us this knowledge and this belief that we did it before. And we can do it again. In full keeping with my tradition of quoting from songs, this is actually a song from Singapore. It is called \u201cThe Road Ahead\u201d. It celebrates (Singapore\u2019s) National Day. And as we celebrate, and we look forward, we know there will be some hurdles to cross. But we know that we can surmount them, because we have done it before. And we can do it again. So, thank you very much to everyone.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering the National Statement at the further resumed fifth session of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference, 19 June 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Ambassador Rena Lee presiding over the further resumed fifth session of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference, 19 June 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, 19 June 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with the President of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si, 19 June 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan hosting a reception at the Permanent Mission of Singapore to the UN on the occasion of the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement, 19 June 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

        "content": "Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, is in Varanasi, India to attend the G20 Development Ministers\u2019 Meeting (DMM).\nAt the DMM, the Development Ministers committed to doubling down on efforts to assist developing countries in accelerating progress, already off-track pre-pandemic, towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. They also emphasised the importance of green development and reaffirmed the importance of tackling the climate crisis and supporting developing countries in their green transition.\nIn his interventions, Minister Maliki suggested areas where the G20 could assist developing countries in achieving the SDGs, for example, the establishment of a framework to provide capacity building to increase digital literacy especially amongst Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, and contribution to the effective reform of the Multilateral Development Banks and the International Financial Institutions. Minister Maliki further emphasised that a multi-pronged approach and prompt global action is necessary to help developing countries mitigate the effects of climate change. The full text of Minister Maliki\u2019s remarks is appended.\nOn the sidelines of the DMM, Minister Maliki met Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, Dr AK Abdul Momen, Minister of Economy of Oman, Dr Said Mohammed Al Saqri, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Economy and Planning of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Dr Yasser Osama Faquih, Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh and Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union Doreen Bogdan-Martin. Minister Maliki and his counterparts reaffirmed strong bilateral ties and had fruitful discussions on regional and international developments.\nMinister Maliki also conveyed signed copies of the Framework Agreement on the Establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Singapore\u2019s Instrument of Ratification during his meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister, Dr S Jaishankar, on 12 June 2023. Singapore\u2019s ISA membership will help to enhance solar energy cooperation with India and other ISA members. In addition, the two Ministers spoke on the next India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable to be held in Singapore later in the year. Minister Maliki had the opportunity to meet Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath and they discussed Singapore\u2019s new investments in the State.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n12 JUNE 2023\n2023 G20 DEVELOPMENT MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nVARANASI, INDIA\nSESSION ONE INTERVENTION\nMULTILATERALISM \u2013 COLLECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARDS SDGs\nMinister Jaishankar\nThank you for inviting Singapore to this important meeting on development.\nColleagues,\nAs many of you have noted, we must do more to implement the 2030 Agenda. However, increased geopolitical tensions, sharpened rivalries amongst major powers, and the deepening North-South divide have resulted in the erosion of multilateralism and made international cooperation, including consensus on statements, more difficult. Further, soaring inflation will affect economic growth, and developing countries will be particularly hard hit as they start from a much lower base.\nThe G20, comprising the world\u2019s major economies, has the heft to galvanize resources, provide global directions, and assist developing countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. Allow me to offer two suggestions.\nFirst, while national actions are important, the G20 could identify one or two concrete areas where they could actively help developing countries. For example, given the importance of digitalisation in transforming economies, G20 members could jointly focus on designing a framework to provide capacity building to increase digital literacy, especially amongst Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). In ASEAN, a market potential of 661 million and 60% aged 35 years and below, we have developed several strategic frameworks and initiatives to guide its digital integration journey including trade facilitation, electronic payments, and logistics, to propel further economic development. Today, it has a young and tech-savvy population. In terms of numbers, Southeast Asia, with more than 70% digital penetration, has an e-commerce market of around US$ 131 billion, and is expected to grow to US$ 330 billion by 2025. Increasing capacity can unlock the full potential of many developing countries.\nSecond, the G20 can contribute to the effective reform of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) so that they are fit for purpose in assisting developing countries achieve the SDGs. For example, the G20 could work with them to develop innovative solutions as public funding is insufficient to meet the huge development financing gap.\nSingapore will also contribute to these efforts and continue our technical assistance to developing countries in areas such as data analytics, public administration, and disaster risk management. Last year, we signed an MOU with the Asian Development Bank to enhance existing collaboration to continue supporting private sector development projects that contribute to Asia Pacific\u2019s infrastructure, financial, and social needs.\nWe will continue to do our part as an active participant in the G20 process.\nThank you.\n2023 G20 DEVELOPMENT MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nVARANASI, INDIA\nSESSION TWO INTERVENTION\nGREEN DEVELOPMENT \u2013\nA LiFE APPROACH\nMinister Jaishankar\nColleagues,\nThe climate crisis is an existential threat to mankind. The world is off-track to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goals, which has resulted in the extreme weather events we see today. \u201cBusiness as usual\u201d will not be enough. A multi-pronged approach and prompt global action is necessary, in particular, to assist developing countries mitigate the effects of climate change.\nLet me cite three areas:\nFirst, capacity building is key. While Small Island Developing States, or SIDS, and other developing countries, such as those in Southeast Asia, may have potential for renewable energy, they could benefit from expertise from developed countries to put in place the necessary infrastructure and policies. Developed countries could also share effective adaptation strategies, including reducing urban heat island effect, restoring natural ecosystems such as mangroves to prevent storm surges, and improving drainage systems.\nSecond, green financing is crucial to increase investments in projects that bring about environmental benefits. An IMF study shows that public adaptation costs exceed 1 percent of GDP in developing countries, and up to 20 percent for certain SIDS. In Southeast Asia, around US$3 trillion of green investment is needed by 2030 in sectors such as infrastructure and agriculture to meet our climate obligations. However, green finance is currently inadequate. This has serious consequences not only for climate change mitigation but also for biodiversity.\nLast but not least, we need to change our mindsets and behaviours, and in this context, we welcome India\u2019s concept of \u201cLiFE\u201d, or Lifestyle for Environment. The Indian proposal of LiFE is an important initiative. We are disappointed it was not included in the final statement. Individuals and communities have a major role to play in mitigating climate change and pursuing green development for any such policies to be sustainable in the long term. To tackle this challenge, it is important to factor in realities on the ground. In many societies, there is limited understanding of environmental issues. In Southeast Asia, for example, UNESCO has described climate change education as \u201cstill very much in its infancy\u201d. Preoccupied with basic needs, entrenched social practices and cultural traditions may also hinder communities from adopting sustainable lifestyles. Hence, we should place greater emphasis on raising awareness within our communities, improving the curriculum in schools and nurturing effective role models in families to promote sustainable practices from young.\nSingapore looks forward to working with the G20 in these efforts. Thank you.\nPhoto caption:Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman attending the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption:Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister of External Affairs of India Dr S Jaishankar meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Dr AK Abdul Momen meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister of Economy of Oman Dr Said Mohammed Al Saqri meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Deputy Minister, Ministry of Economy and Planning of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Dr Yasser Osama Faquih meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union Doreen Bogdan-Martin meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 12 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting, 11 June 2023.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

        "country": "Singapore",
        "content": "Ministers,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished guests,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nGood afternoon.\nI am happy to be here to deliver the 2023 S Rajaratnam Lecture\na.Mr S Rajaratnam for whom this Lecture is named, was the chief architect of our foreign policy, putting in place fundamental principles that have served us well since our independence.\nb.As Singapore\u2019s first Foreign Minister during a tumultuous period for post-independent Singapore, Mr Rajaratnam also deftly navigated the challenges of the Cold War era, balancing our relations with the West and our commitments to the Non-Aligned Movement and the Third World.\nc.In his address to the UN General Assembly upon Singapore\u2019s membership into the UN on 21 September 1965, Mr Rajaratnam stressed Singapore\u2019s path of non-alignment.\ni.Where Singapore had decided for itself that we would not be drawn into narrow power bloc interests where one side sought to impose its values on another or undermine another\u2019s way of life.\nii.This did not mean, however, that Singapore would be indifferent to issues of right and wrong or avoid taking a stand on issues inimical to our interests for fear of displeasing bigger and more powerful countries.\niii.We have continued to uphold this position and our respect for the basic principles of the UN Charter. We took a firm stand on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which was a clear and gross violation of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter and international law.\nd.At a time when Singapore faced the question of how we would make our way in the world, Mr Rajaratnam was a visionary who in 1972 envisaged Singapore as a \u201cGlobal City\u201d, long before the term gained popularity decades later.\ni.He saw Singapore thriving beyond the bounds of our geography and history if we could view the world as our hinterland, doing business with the entire global community.\ne.This revolutionary concept has since remained a bedrock of our foreign policy as a small country with an open economy.\nf.With these guiding principles in place, MFA has over the years, built strong relationships with our neighbours and the wider international community.\ni.We continue to expand our diplomatic footprint. In 2022, we opened a new Embassy in Tel Aviv to strengthen our innovation partnership with Israel and support Singapore companies seeking greater collaboration with Israeli partners.We set up a Representative Office in Ramallah to support our technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority. We also upgraded Singapore\u2019s Consulate-General in Oman to an Embassy. Even where we do not have a physical presence on the ground, we do our best to help. We recently launched the Singapore-Timor Leste ASEAN Readiness Support (Stars) package to offer training to Timor-Leste officials to help them prepare for their ASEAN membership.\nii.While we continue to navigate the ups and downs in our relationships with our immediate neighbours, we have also made progress on key issues such as airspace and defence cooperation, and ventured into new areas such as the digital economy, sustainability, and connectivity.\niii.Internationally, we champion the interests of fellow small states with whom we share common vulnerabilities.We led the formation of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) in 1992, which today comprises 108 countries across all regions.We set up the Global Governance Group (3G), a group of 30 small and medium-sized members of the UN to promote greater transparency and inclusivity in the G20 process.\nCharting our future in turbulent times\nToday, more than half a century since Singapore\u2019s independence, the world has become much more economically and technologically advanced and integrated. However, Singapore\u2019s existential circumstances are unchanged.\nWe are reminded more than ever of our vulnerability as a small nation with the challenges posed by the external environment, in the form of rising geopolitical tensions, increasing polarisation in many societies, and technological disruptions.Transboundary crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change render a small island state like Singapore particularly vulnerable.\nDiplomacy today is a far more complex task. We cannot assume that open markets and globalisation are part of the \u2018natural order\u2019, especially in the face of rising protectionist, insular and nationalist sentiments. These challenges are compounded by the speed at which misinformation and disinformation are spread through social media.\nThe external environment will remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\na.The deep mistrust and intensifying strategic competition between the US and China are having a significant negative impact on the existing multilateral trading system, which has benefitted many countries including Singapore.\ni.There is now increased risk of technological and economic decoupling and bifurcation.\nii.Countries are also embracing more muscular industrial policies with the US, China, and the EU pursuing export controls in key strategic areas as well as tax breaks and subsidies to develop domestic strengths in critical industries.\niii.Businesses are also reorganising themselves in response to these geopolitical conditions. More MNCs are looking to re-shore back home or to friendly countries to avoid being caught in geo-strategic crossfires.\nb.As a result, the possibility of triggering unintended consequences has become more real.\ni.Closer to home, we face the threat of conflict in the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea. While all sides do not wish for war, a single mishap or miscalculation could easily spiral into open conflict.\nii.We also face the threat of nuclear proliferation. Limited progress towards a renewed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the suspension of Russia\u2019s participation in the New START nuclear arms treaty have heightened chances of miscalculations.\niii.Technological advances have led to new classes of weapons such as hypersonic missiles and drones. Cyber warfare, supported by advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, has reinforced strategic deterrence. But it has also upped the ante in the targeting and control of strategic assets.\nc.From our days as an entrepot trade settlement to our current hub status for finance, logistics and other services, Singapore has relied on an open trading environment and an inclusive, rules-based international order. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw many weaknesses in global cooperation and supply chain connectivity. Countries were unprepared for a such a global crisis, and scrambled for medical supplies and vaccines. Nativist instincts made many countries turn inwards.\ni.Countries only began to share resources when it became clear that a global response was needed to ensure everyone\u2019s safety in a highly connected world.\nii.The next pandemic can erupt anytime.We learnt from COVID-19 that multilateral cooperation is the only way to deal with such global issues.We need to think global even as we act local.\nd.In recent years, we have seen a rise in popular nationalism as shocks such as the pandemic, and other national economic crises, heightened reactionary, anti-globalisation tendencies.\ni.Internally, many countries are facing increasingly divisive politics and a polarisation of views. Building domestic consensus has become harder even on key issues.\nii.Politics in some countries is no longer a discourse about what is best for the country\u2019s long-term future but driven by immediate and narrow interests.\niii.This has led to massive protests and even unrest both in the developed and developing world, exacerbated by factors such as a widening urban-rural divide, perceived unequal political representation, and unfair distribution of economic opportunities and income.\nForeign Policy: Strengthened with Domestic Resilience\nIn this troubling external environment, our unity as a nation and our resolve to stand together is even more critical.\nMr Rajaratnam knew this well. His enduring legacy in the words of our National Pledge exemplified his belief that a young nation made up of people from different backgrounds, races and religions could only have a chance of survival and success as a Global City, if it could come together under a shared identity as \u201cone united people\u201d.\nForeign policy and the conduct of our diplomacy rests on our domestic unity and resilience.\na.The COVID-19 pandemic underscored just how important resilience is. Singapore was successful in managing the pandemic because Singaporeans trusted the Government. Our people closed ranks and played their part to keep each other safe by complying with safe management measures. Our robust healthcare system and safety nets built over many years made a crucial difference too.\nb.Strengthening resilience and trust within society will similarly allow us to respond nimbly in this increasingly uncertain external environment, to protect our independence and sovereignty and continue expanding Singapore\u2019s space internationally.\nBut this will be challenging as our society matures, and people have different aspirations and ideals.\na.It will require us to find ways to accommodate each other and strive for consensus to build on what has already been achieved.\nb.Failure to do so risks internal divisions being exploited by others especially in the digital age.\nTo build resilience, it is essential for all Singaporeans to feel that they have a stake in its future.This is the main purpose of the Forward Singapore exercise led by DPM Lawrence Wong, to renew and update our social compact, even as we refresh our goals and strategies.\na.Strong institutions including the public service and a government that works hard to keep the trust of its people are essential.\nb.We must also continually work towards a society that is fair and inclusive, and able to adapt to changing circumstances.\ni.This means re-examining fundamentals to ensure that our system of meritocracy does not result in an entrenchment of privileges and advantages.\nii.Equally important is the need to continue investing in education and skills training, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, and creating a business environment that encourages risk-taking and experimentation.\ncOur efforts include uplifting lower-income workers and families and empowering them to improve their lives, and enhancing support for those among us with special needs and their caregivers.\ni.I am glad that Singaporeans have responded strongly to the President\u2019s Challenge, which has grown from strength to strength since it was started in 2000. The initiative has grown over the years, reaching out to more donors, partners, and volunteers. In 2022, the President\u2019s Challenge raised S$17.3 million, the highest amount since the campaign started.This is a testament to the strong sense of community and social responsibility that Singaporeans feel towards one another, and is a reminder that even in challenging times, we can come together to make a positive difference in the lives of others.\nWe must remember that our diversity as a multi-racial and multi-religious society is our strength. We must protect this.\na.Laws such as the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act exist to safeguard this precious facet of our societal fabric. But laws alone are not sufficient.\nb.We must be proactive in finding common ground with those who are different from ourselves. Platforms such as our Harmony Circles create opportunities for dialogue between communities of different faiths and ethnicities, allowing bonds of trust, compassion and mutual understanding to be formed.\nc.This is where our youth have an important role to play as bridge-builders.\ni.I launched the Harmony Champions Programme in February this year, a collaboration between the youth-driven initiative Roses of Peace and Temasek Foundation, to nurture youths to be advocates of inter-racial and inter-religious harmony.\nii.We must continue to equip our youth with the knowledge and skills to facilitate conversations on sensitive issues in a constructive manner. The Civic Conversations Toolkit on Race & Religion that the National Youth Council launched last year is a step in the right direction.\nWe can also learn from other countries\u2019 efforts at forging social cohesion and resilience.\na.I had first raised the idea of convening an International Conference on Cohesive Societies to promote interfaith and multicultural dialogue, which Singapore hosted in 2019 and 2022.\nb.We have participated in similar forums abroad, such as the Bahrain Forum for Dialogue.\nA strong Singapore core is crucial to guard against external influences, subtle and overt, that seek to divide us.\na.Natural fault lines in a society like ours can be easily exploited. Disinformation and misinformation can spread easily in an open and digitally connected country, through social media and instant messaging applications. We are susceptible to external influences, which can be difficult to discern as they are subtle and appear innocuous.\nb.We must be discerning enough to call out half-truths or one-sided views peddled on social media that are packaged as news. To curb attempts at foreign interference and hostile falsehoods spread by parties with ill intent towards Singapore, we have legislative levers like FICA and POFMA.\nc.But beyond legislation, the most effective way to counter falsehoods is to make sure that we check the sources to distinguish the sensational from the factual. We must be sceptical of what we read and reflect on who might stand to benefit from it.\nExpanding Networks and Seeking Out Opportunities\nAs we forge ahead as a Global City, I am glad to see that Singaporeans are increasingly being recognised for their expertise, professionalism, and commitment to promoting regional and global cooperation. These reflect growing recognition that despite our small size, Singapore can play our part in contributing to global solutions.\na.In 2020, Daren Tang became the first Singaporean to head a UN agency, when he was elected as the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\nb.Earlier this year, Rena Lee, Singapore\u2019s Ambassador for Oceans and Law of the Sea, presided over the conclusion of negotiations on a new high seas treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The Agreement is an achievement for multilateralism amidst intensifying geopolitical rivalry and demonstrates that the international community can rally together to address global issues.The consensus outcome is also a testament to Singapore\u2019s position as a trusted bridge-builder in the international community, as well as our leadership role in developing the international law of the sea.\nc.For the first time, Singapore has nominated one of its climate scientists, Associate Professor Winston Chow, as a candidate to the bureau of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN\u2019s top climate science body, to serve as the co-Chair for the IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability to climate change. We hope that Winston will be successfully elected and can contribute to the IPCC\u2019s important work.\nWhile the global landscape is increasingly complex and uncertain, there remain bright spots on the horizon for our Global City:\na.First, even as the multilateral trading system is being tested, we can work with like-minded partners to advance greater economic integration and liberalisation of global trade and investment.\ni.Our neighbourhood is home to some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and is a major driver of global growth and development. However, the region is also facing significant challenges, including geopolitical tensions, territorial disputes, and economic inequality. In such a complex environment, building trust, understanding and cooperation among countries is more important than ever.\nii.We have encouraged major powers, including the US and China, to continue to step up engagement of Singapore and countries in the region, and they have done so, through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\niii.The signing of the ASEAN-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in November 2020 was a positive step towards building regional trust and cooperation through economic integration. RCEP is the world\u2019s largest Free Trade Agreement (FTA), comprising about 30 per cent of global GDP and about a third of the world\u2019s population. Last week, the RCEP came into force for all Parties.\niv.There are many other complementary groupings that Singapore is a part of, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. These have continued to grow in economic coverage to build a resilient and interlocking network of cooperation between countries across the globe.\nb.We constantly seek to expand our economic ties with key economic blocs. Amidst the pandemic, we signed an FTA with the Pacific Alliance in 2022, a dynamic grouping comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, and have also reached a substantive conclusion on negotiations for an FTA with MERCOSUR, comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These two FTAs will join our network of existing in-force FTAs with other blocs such as the EU and GCC, to increase trade and investment opportunities for our businesses and enhance people-to-people linkages between our regions.\nc.Second, Southeast Asia is a region full of potential.ASEAN forms the fifth largest economy globally. With its young and dynamic population of 60 per cent under the age of 35, fast-growing urban middle class, and the widespread use of digital technologies, we should continue to tap on the opportunities in ASEAN, particularly in emerging areas such as digital and green economies, as well as in engaging external parties.\ni.A key milestone in the development of ASEAN\u2019s digital economy was the signing of the Agreement on Electronic Commerce during Singapore\u2019s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2018. Today, under Indonesia\u2019s Chairmanship, ASEAN is set to advance negotiations on a Digital Economy Framework Agreement that will serve to enhance the region\u2019s digital economic integration.\nii.ASEAN is also looking to deepen its cooperation in the production of clean energy and the green economy. The ongoing LTMS power integration project which involves the import of hydropower from Laos to Singapore through Thailand and Malaysia, is an excellent example of such collaboration and a pathfinder towards realising an ASEAN Power Grid. It is a win-win proposition that will allow us to progress in our regional decarbonisation journey while diversifying our energy sources.\niii.ASEAN is pursuing FTAs with new partners like Canada as well as upgrading existing ones, such as with Australia, New Zealand, China, and India, for the post-pandemic economy. Beyond trade, Singapore also played an active leadership role in the conclusion of the world\u2019s first bloc-to-bloc air transport agreement between ASEAN and the EU in 2022.\nd.Lastly, it is important that we remain open to new opportunities and partnerships. Regions such as Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa have seen dynamic and rapid growth. It is timely for Singapore to capitalise on the accelerated pace of growth in these emerging markets.\ni.We have cemented Singapore\u2019s presence in our traditional markets. We must continue to diversify our market reach, so that we not only reduce our reliance on any one market or region, but also avail ourselves to new relationships to ensure our economic prosperity and sustainability.\nii.There are many opportunities for collaboration with new markets, including in sectors such as health-tech, agri-tech, transport and logistics, and urban solutions.\niii.Singaporeans and homegrown businesses must continue to venture into these new and emerging markets, and we will continue to support such efforts:\nThese are steps in the right direction, and we must press on notwithstanding the challenges and inherent risks in diversification. Despite the sharpening of geopolitical rivalries, and temptation to turn inward in an increasingly uncertain world, we must continue to cast our gaze wide, working together to face current global challenges for the sake of our future generations.\nConclusion\nLadies and Gentlemen\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate three points: -\na.First, the primary task of our foreign policy is to safeguard and advance Singapore\u2019s national interest. Our survival depends on making friends and establishing close relations with the rest of the world in pursuit of common interests. Many of the issues that affect the world today require global cooperation and innovative solutions. Issues such as climate change, global health and cybersecurity are of such a magnitude that no country can solve them alone. We must continue to advocate for dialogue and engagement to achieve peaceful solutions, instead of war or conflicts where there are no winners.\nb.As a global city with an open economy, we depend on a functioning and effective multilateral trading system which is now under tremendous strain. Despite this, there are still many opportunities to work with like-minded partners, in the region and globally, to expand trade and business ties and to venture into new areas of growth.\nc.Third, to be able to protect and advance our interests internationally, we need a strong, resilient, and cohesive Singapore so that our voice matters when we speak. Singapore\u2019s stability and cohesion have allowed us to protect and advance our interests over the past 58 years despite the ever-evolving geopolitical realities. This is not solely the work of policymakers and diplomats. All Singaporeans have a part to play in making Singapore strong, stable, and cohesive.\nI am confident that our future will be bright as Singaporeans remain resilient and united; stay open and connected to the world; and innovatively forge new paths to benefit our country and people.\nThank you."

They committed to continue to work together to strengthen and reform the WTO, including the dispute settlement system. The Leaders reaffirmed the importance of maintaining open and predictable trade links and developing resilient global supply chains for mutual prosperity and growth in an increasingly volatile geopolitical environment.\nThe Leaders noted the good progress made by the bilateral Supply Chains Working Group established in September 2022 in strengthening cooperation in the areas of food, energy security, as well as connectivity and crisis response.

As the CSP approaches its 10th anniversary in 2025, the Leaders agreed that bilateral cooperation under the next phase of the CSP should be ambitious, strategic and dynamic, and looked forward to the charting of the agenda for the next chapter of Singapore-Australia relations.\nThe Leaders exchanged views on regional and global developments. They reaffirmed the central role of ASEAN and the ASEAN-led regional architecture and reaffirmed their commitment to work together to support practical implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, including through the ambitious ASEAN-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.

The Leaders welcomed the Upgrade of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), and were pleased to note the progress made on implementing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The Leaders committed to ongoing cooperation on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to preserve and advance its high standards and consensus-based approach.\nThe Leaders discussed the importance of working closely with partners in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region to ensure the region remains open, stable and prosperous. They welcomed the Quad\u2019s support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, including the Quad\u2019s agenda to support Indo-Pacific countries\u2019 priorities and needs.\nThe Leaders acknowledged that Australia and Singapore faced an era of heightened geostrategic uncertainty and threats to the international rules-based order. They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which supports and promotes free trade and open markets and respects the rights of countries to lead their national existence free from external interference, subversion and coercion. They noted the importance of working together to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region, reiterated their opposition to unilateral actions that change the status quo, and emphasised the importance of diplomacy to avoid the risks of miscalculation. The Leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintain and promote security and stability in the South China Sea and underscored their strong support for freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded trade, and emphasised the need for the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).They emphasised the primacy of UNCLOS, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.

They strongly condemned the attack on the ASEAN humanitarian convoy in Shan State in May 2023, and urged the regime to allow safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance. The Leaders called for the release of those unjustly detained. They also urged the Myanmar military regime to end violence, engage in inclusive dialogue, and facilitate humanitarian assistance, in line with ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus. They reaffirmed the importance of working together to contribute to ASEAN\u2019s efforts, including those of Indonesia as ASEAN Chair, to facilitate peace and national reconciliation in Myanmar. They also reaffirmed the important roles of the UN, ASEAN, and other partners in facilitating a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Myanmar.\nThe Leaders strongly condemned Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine which is a gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of international law. The sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected. Consistent with UN General Assembly Resolution No. A/RES/ES-11/6 dated 23 February 2023, the Leaders called for Russia\u2019s immediate withdrawal of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine, as part of delivering a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible. Aside from terrible damage and loss of life in Ukraine, the war is also compounding human suffering and exacerbating the global crisis in food and energy security, including in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and to strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as its cornerstone. The Leaders concurred that the use, or threat of use, of nuclear weapons is serious and inadmissible and called for urgent implementation of nuclear risk reduction measures. As the leaders of the five Nuclear-Weapon States themselves declared on 3 January 2022, \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u201d.\nThe Leaders looked forward to the next Annual Leaders\u2019 Meeting in Australia in 2024."

I just want to make three points.\nWe are not going to reach this hope for prosperity if, number one, you do not have peace; number two, if you get our organising principle for the Asia-Pacific wrong; and thirdly if we demolish the global multilateral, rules-based trading system.\nFirst, on peace. In the past three decades, a lot of us assumed that war was unthinkable in Europe. Now, we are one year past Russia's unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign independent state. It is, in our view, a flagrant violation of international law and the principles of the UN Charter.\nBecause we are so small, we cannot accept any violation of a country\u2019s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity under any pretext. So, number one, we still need to secure the peace \u2013 do not take it for granted.\nThe second point I want to make is that we all know that the economic potential for Southeast Asia is great. In fact, our population of 670 million is an EU-sized population. Our combined GDP is still small \u2013 it is only US$3.1 trillion, but that number will double and quadruple in the coming decades.\nThe organising principle for our region is to keep it open, inclusive and rules-based. Particularly to keep our region open to China, the US, EU and indeed any other power that wishes to invest, trade and connect with us.\nOur vision is not to draw lines throughout, but to have overlapping circles of friends, partners, investors. We want to give all superpowers and middle powers a stake in our collective prosperity, development and stability, and in so doing create a stable balance of power. So, it is different from the situation which exists within the EU.\nMy third point \u2013 and this again I speak from the view of Singapore \u2013 is that we all know the global multilateral rules-based trading system is under siege. Countries all over the world are prioritising their domestic political concerns, their national security concerns, the resurgence of industrial policy, and quite frankly, this leads into a race to the bottom for subsidies, tax breaks, and frank protectionism. This shift away from the consensus which has supported globalisation for the past seven decades has serious implications, and especially for small, open economies like Singapore. The IMF (International Monetary Fund) has estimated that the fragmentation of the global economy - some people call it a bifurcation.\nThis fragmentation could reduce the global GDP in the long-term by about 7%, which sounds like a big number. But we believe the true cost of bifurcation will be felt not just in terms of goods and services forgone, but the opportunities lost because of a paucity or a loss of the options for exchange of ideas, innovation, technological development, capital flows and cross-border financing.\nThis will be deeply inimical to our collective interests. In fact, it will call into question the formula that has held the peace, security and prosperity which was hitherto, available in Europe, and still progressing well in the Asia Pacific.\nWe therefore call on the EU, which has been a champion for multilateralism, a rules-based trading system and economic integration, to play a leading political, intellectual, and philosophical role and to make common cause for us to maintain this open, rules-based global trading system based on organising ourselves for efficiency, collectively working on a common technological stack, diffusing and democratising the fruits of research and development and thereby achieving prosperity for all of us. If we are successful, our two regions will be exquisitely positioned to harness these new opportunities which are emerging in front of us \u2013 Artificial Intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and renewable energy.\nI look forward to working closely with the EU as a like-minded partner. We believe that the EU will be a force for stability, inclusion, and in that sense, sustained prosperity for both our regions.

As one of the IOC\u2019s founding co-partners, Singapore had hosted the inaugural IOC in 2016. Since then, the IOC has emerged as a key consultative forum for states and principal maritime partners of the region to engage and deliberate on cooperation, security, and growth in the region.\nOver the last three thousand years, the Indian Ocean has been an essential conduit for trade, culture, religion, knowledge, language, and geostrategic influence. Thus, this year\u2019s theme of \u201cPeace, Prosperity and Partnership for a Resilient Future\u201d is indeed very salient. In particular, South Asian influences in heritage, language, and religion, borne across the waves of the Indian Ocean, are evident in Southeast Asia. Even today, Sanskrit remains a legacy in our languages, and influences of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam remain in our belief systems.\nThe Indian Ocean region holds tremendous geopolitical, economic, and strategic importance. Extending from the eastern coast of Africa to the western coast of Australia, the Indian Ocean accounts for one-fifth of the water on the Earth\u2019s surface. A significant portion of global maritime traffic flows through the Indian Ocean from Asia\u2019s industrialised nations to the rest of the world. More than 70% of the world\u2019s oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean, as does 50% of container traffic. There is no question that the Indian Ocean is of strategic importance for all of us.\nGlobal challenges\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted countries around the world, including those in the Indian Ocean region. We all faced disruptions to our economies, supply chains, connectivity networks, border management, regional security, critical health infrastructure and tourism, just to name a few. We saw how international connectivity is a double-edged sword \u2013 while it enhanced international trade, it can also disable trade links. But the crisis also provided an opportunity for countries to work together in both traditional and non-traditional areas, relook existing institutions and regional mechanisms, and revamp them in order to better serve today\u2019s needs. It reminds us even more how important it is to work together, uphold multilateral trading systems and resist protectionist policies. I am heartened that today, we can once again meet in person. This is in no small part due to the collective effort and resilience of all countries in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmidst the background of other international crises such as the Russia-Ukraine war, there have been major disruptions to trade and critical supply chains, and deep uncertainty has arisen about the future of multilateral institutions. As the world\u2019s major powers become increasingly assertive of their own interests, the hitherto hard-won consensus on international rules and norms is breaking down before our very eyes.\nImpact of Climate Change\nOn top of the disruptions I just mentioned, countries in the Indian Ocean region are also grappling with the existential challenge of climate change. The Sixth Assessment Report or AR6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently concluded \u201cwith very high confidence\u201d that the Indian Ocean\u2019s surface has warmed faster than the global average. This presents a host of challenges for the Indian Ocean states, including the intensification of monsoon rains, marine biodiversity loss and sea-level rise.\nIn particular, rising sea-levels have serious cascading effects on many other areas, such as the economy, livelihoods, health and well-being, as well as food and water security. As a low-lying state, with more than 50% of our population living within 3.5 kilometres off the coast, Singapore feels this as acutely as other small island states in the Indian Ocean. Given that AR6 has concluded that it is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that global mean sea levels will continue to rise until at least 2100, we will have to grapple with this problem. Countries in the Indian Ocean region must work together urgently to support the full implementation of the Paris Agreement and strengthen our collective resilience against rising sea levels. From November to December 2023, the UNFCCC COP-28 in Dubai will aim to make progress on raising mitigation ambition and implementation, scaling up adaptation efforts, operationalising the new funding arrangements, as well as boosting climate finance, technology, and capacity building support for developing countries.\nBangladesh and Its Role\nIt is therefore timely that the Bangladesh government is hosting this important conference. Bangladesh\u2019s early history, culture and legacy are closely intertwined with the ebb and flow of its 700 rivers into the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of the Indian Ocean. The silt-rich waters from the Himalayas flowing through Bangladesh made it one of the most fertile lands in the sub-continent famed for its agricultural resources. Ancient Bengal achieved remarkable influence through a web of riverine and maritime lanes extending through the Bay of Bengal and to points further east. Today, modern Bangladesh is a strategic maritime nation promoting sustainable and equitable utilisation of oceanic resources.\nAs one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, Bangladesh plays an increasingly significant role in the Indian Ocean. Major projects are underway in Bangladesh which will improve the overall connectivity in the Indian Ocean region. Among them are the development of the Matarbari deep seaport in Cox\u2019s Bazar, and upgrades to Chittagong Port as the principal seaport handling 92% of the country\u2019s trade. This will put Bangladesh in good stead to provide maritime trade routes and facilities to the land-locked Northeast of India, as well as to Nepal and Bhutan. At the same time, we appreciate Bangladesh\u2019s contributions to regional and subregional cooperation. It played a pivotal role in the formation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation or BIMSTEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association.\nSingapore\u2019s interest in the Indian Ocean\nAs a small island state situated at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, Singapore\u2019s survival and prosperity have always been inextricably linked to the oceans. Sea-freight accounts for a large proportion of our imports, including of essential supplies. With trade more than thrice our GDP, ensuring the safety and security of key trade routes such as the Straits of Malacca and Singapore is of vital importance to Singapore.\nSingapore is therefore firmly committed to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. UNCLOS is fundamental for upholding the right of all States to freedom of navigation and overflight, maintaining open trade routes and sea lines of communication, and promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. Singapore is strongly committed to working with like-minded partners to ensure that all maritime activities in the Indian Ocean are carried out in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS.\nUNCLOS has also proven to be dynamic and highly adaptable in responding to emerging issues. On 4 March 2023, the Intergovernmental Conference presided over by Singapore\u2019s Ambassador for Oceans and Law of the Sea Issues Rena Lee successfully concluded negotiations on a new international agreement under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, or BBNJ. The BBNJ Agreement is a landmark achievement in oceans law and will provide a critical boost to global efforts to protect the marine environment. We look forward to the universal adoption and swift implementation of the BBNJ Agreement.\nLet me also take this opportunity to offer a perspective as an ASEAN Member State. Southeast Asia lies in the centre of the Asia Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and serves as a very important conduit and portal to the two regions. We have consistently advocated for an open and inclusive regional architecture and engaging external partners, to give everyone a greater stake in the region\u2019s peace, stability, and development. As the international order increasingly comes under strain, it is even more important that all of us redouble efforts to engage constructively, and uphold the ASEAN-led open, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture. In 2019, ASEAN Leaders agreed on an ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, which outlines ASEAN\u2019s perspectives on how external partners should engage the region on its own merits. We look forward to partnering the countries in the Indian Ocean region in this regard.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude. Six conferences on, we are all in agreement that we want an Indian Ocean built on peace, stability, and prosperity. As leaders, we owe it to our people and the future generation to ensure we succeed in doing so. We have remained committed to enhancing dialogue, building trust, and upholding a rules-based international order. We must also continue to engage our counterparts from other regions. I hope this conference will generate concrete solutions so that we can respond to global challenges cohesively, collectively, and creatively. I look forward to a constructive dialogue on how we can further collaborate in the Indian Ocean for the future of our peoples. Thank you very much.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n13 MAY 2023\nPhoto caption: Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Second Minister for Education, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman speaking at the sixth Indian Ocean Conference.\nPhoto credit: India Foundation"

        "country": "Australia",
        "content": "Professor Sally Wheeler, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of ANU\nProfessor Helen Sullivan, Dean of the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific\nProfessor Evelyn Goh, Director of the ANU Southeast Asia Institute\nExcellencies\nLadies and Gentlemen\nI am honoured to be here today. To be honest, I am quite surprised to see so many people here. I did not think this was a topic that would attract this level of attention but thank you for being here. The theme of \u201ccrossroads, lifelines and guardrails\u201d is quite apt considering the enormous geopolitical challenges confronting us today.\nCrossroads: The Strategic Environment\nLet us start off with this map \u2013 it is obvious both from geography and history that Southeast Asia has always been at the crossroads. A certain aspect worth highlighting is that if you wanted to connect Europe to China, India to Northeast Asia, Australasia and the Pacific, it is obvious from this map that the crossroads, the focal point, is Southeast Asia. In fact, I was just checking ChatGPT just as Sally was speaking. The question I asked was, \u201cHow did the First Nation people reach Australia?\u201d According to ChatGPT \u2013 and let me just read it out so you do not blame me if it is wrong \u2013 it says, \u201cOne popular theory is that they arrived by sea, possibly from Southeast Asia.\u201d You see, Southeast Asia again. This theory is supported by the fact that the sea levels were lower during the last ice age, which would have made it easier to cross the water between Southeast Asia and Australia. It is also supported by genetic and linguistic evidence which suggest that the original Australians share some ancestry and cultural features with the populations in Southeast Asia. So history rhymes, even if it does not repeat itself.\nThe other geographical point worth noting is that if you look between India and China, the Himalayas and the dense jungles of Myanmar form quite a barrier for interaction between two ancient civilisations. The result of this was that most of the exchange occurred via the maritime route and hence Evelyn\u2019s map. If you think about the historical aspects of it, geography, culture, religion, trade, investments, military power have always been brought to bear and transmitted through this exquisitely open and, if I may add, vulnerable focal point.\nIf you fast forward to today, we are at another inflection point. This is due to a profound reordering of the geostrategic order and a fundamental economic transformation due to simultaneous accelerated advances in AI, robotics, biotechnology and the energy transformation needed to deal with climate change. We are still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. But I can tell you with a fair amount of certainty as a medical practitioner myself, there will be another one. And it will probably be sooner rather than later. In addition, at a domestic level, all countries, all politicians, are confronting a society which are beset with domestic challenges like inequality, polarisation, hyper-nationalism \u2013 sometimes even outright xenophobia \u2013 and hyper-ageing. This in effect is a perfect storm.\nAustralia finds herself at a crossroads too. Although you may not be the centre of Southeast Asia, the fact is you are not immune to what happens in Southeast and Northeast Asia, and indeed the Pacific. Foreign Minister Penny Wong recently expressed concern about a \u201ccontested region\u201d facing \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d, where strategic competition is playing out on multiple levels. I completely agree with her. Faced with these increasing, challenging circumstances, Australia will have to decide how to exercise agency to pursue your own long-term national interests. Australia may be an island continent, but it is not immune to the challenges and waves and tsunamis that will sweep through Southeast Asia and beyond.\nThe world is now far more complex and in fact more interdependent than before. Evelyn showed a nice photograph of a house on stilts. You were trying to allude to a movement from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. Well, my slight disagreement with you on that is that while there are going to be multiple stilts, you are not going to witness the symmetry where all poles are equal. It is going to be multipolar but asymmetrical. The other point is that those stilts are going to be changing their heights quite dynamically because of all the transformations which are occurring economically, politically, in science, and in society. Bear that in mind, you are dealing with multiple stilts changing their heights dynamically. Achieving balance, achieving stability in such an environment is extremely difficult.\nIf you switch your minds back to the economic sphere, for both Australia and Singapore, we are dependent on trade for our prosperity. Trade is about 40% of Australia\u2019s GDP, while Singapore\u2019s trade volume is three times of our GDP. It is a highly skewed ratio, and that has to do with the fact that we are a hub, a transhipment focal point in the hub of Southeast Asia. In addition, both Singapore and Australia have concerns with major superpower rivalry. We both know if this is unchecked, and it leads on \u2013 and we see early signs of that bifurcation and the weaponisation of trade, supply chains and even of money \u2013 what this means for trading-oriented nations like ours, is that we will be witnessing many nations turning inwards.\nWe will witness the elevation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers for trade and a bifurcation must lead to: first, higher inflation because supply chains will no longer be organised on the basis of efficiency but on the basis of \u201cjust in case\u201d. That means paying a premium for resilience. Second, in addition to inflation, bifurcation must mean a slower rate of progress. Instead of the whole world working to improve that single technology stack that defines modern society, you now split into competing camps working on different and likely, possibly, incompatible systems of technology. Third, a bifurcated world is one in which there is less interdependence, less inhibitions to not only just outright, extreme competition, but even confrontation. We will be living in a more disruptive, more volatile, more dangerous world.\nGuardrails: US-China Relations\nThis brings me to the next aspect \u2013 guardrails \u2013 and that is usually discussed in terms of US-China relations. The US and China are currently locked in perhaps one of the most intense competitions across multiple domains in our lifetimes. At the heart of it \u2013 and I say this as a regular visitor to Washington and Beijing, even during COVID times \u2013 at the heart of this dysfunctional relationship is deep mutual suspicion and an almost complete absence of strategic trust on both sides.\nThe US believes that China \u201cis the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective\u201d. Keywords: \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d. It is now a settled bipartisan view in the US that China\u2019s rising power is inimical to American interests and values. In this view, for national security reasons, the US must go for \u201cextreme competition\u201d and it must seek to maintain an \u201cabsolute advantage\u201d over China especially in foundational technologies, which include semiconductors, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and green technologies.\nFrom the point of view of China, perceptions of the US have also soured considerably. Almost everyone I have met in Beijing believes that the US intends to \u201ccontain, encircle and suppress\u201d China. And if this strategic misalignment is not enough, you also have a trigger, a fuse, waiting to be lit. The most dangerous flashpoint of all is Taiwan, which is the reddest of red lines for Beijing. Singapore, Australia, and almost every other country in the world maintains some version of a \u201cOne China\u201d policy. However, cross-strait relations have been framed by some in the West as a broader ideological contest on the issue of \u201cdemocracy versus autocracy\u201d. Actually, I think taking this view is deeply worrying and dangerous. The status quo that has prevailed for several decades was predicated on all parties exercising restraint and maintaining the status quo. Right now, however, it is clearly evident that tensions are high and rising, and the risk of mishap or miscalculation is even higher, and with that, the risk of an escalatory spiral. If that happens, it will trigger grave consequences for all of us.\nLifelines: Vital Connections\nLet me move to lifelines and talk about vital connections. Of course, I believe all of us in this room and indeed, at a national level, hope that the US and China will keep lines of communications open, and with time, gradually repair their relationship on the basis of mutual respect and the gradual accumulation of strategic trust. This point of mutual respect and strategic trust is worth emphasising, because you cannot at a political or diplomatic level, hope to neatly distribute issues into cooperation, competition and confrontation. It does not work that way in Asia or in Southeast Asia. It starts first with a relationship, and a relationship begins with whether there is at least mutual respect \u2013 you do not have to agree, you do not even have to like\u2014but you need to have mutual respect.\nThe second ingredient for a productive, functional relationship is the gradual accumulation of strategic trust. And note that I said \u201cgradual accumulation\u201d because trust is not something you conjure just with a sophisticated form of words. It takes time, it takes history, it takes a pattern of behaviour that accumulates strategic trust. Right now, these two critical ingredients are missing.\nCountries in Southeast Asia feel this impact of dysfunctional relations between the two biggest superpowers and we feel it keenly. In fact, we all hope and pray that the lifelines and the lines of communication between the two of them will be established, will be nurtured and will grow. That is the only way in which we can see a productive way out of this otherwise insoluble dilemma.\nThe US and China are struggling to make progress on areas where they really do need to focus on public goods for the world \u2013 climate change, energy, food security, pandemic preparedness, to mention a few. But the economic imperatives are often overshadowed by national security concerns. Countries are pursuing self-reliance and resilience, and I mentioned \u201con-shoring\u201d or \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d supply chains. I also mentioned the impact of increasing bifurcation in technological and economic systems.\nBut again, if you turn the focus back on Southeast Asia, actually all of us want both China and the US to be engaged in Southeast Asia, all of us want to have productive, friendly relations with both, and all of us do not want to be forced to choose sides, to make invidious choices.\nAustralia\u2019s Domestic Strengths\nI believe many of these sentiments apply to Australia as well. In fact, Australia can play an important stabilising role in our region and Australia has many unique strengths. Here, let me offer a perspective from someone from outside Australia about Australia\u2019s value proposition because sometimes when you live within the system, you fail to see the value proposition that you have for outsiders. So let me list that.\nFirst, Australia can and should take the lead in pushing for green, biotech and digital revolutions, within Australia and in Southeast Asia and beyond. This is not just empty flattery, but it is actually based on careful inventory of Australia\u2019s resources. Australia is one of world\u2019s largest producers of bauxite, iron ore, lithium, gold, lead, diamond, rare earth elements, uranium and zinc. My standard parlour question to Australian business leaders or political leaders is, \u201cName me one element that Australia is short of.\u201d So far no one has been able to give me an answer for that.\nNow, let\u2019s focus specifically on the critical minerals needed for the new, emerging digital and green economy. If you focus on critical minerals, I discovered that Australia has the worlds largest deposits of nickel, Australia has the second largest deposits of lithium, cobalt and copper, the fourth largest deposits of manganese and the sixth largest deposits of rare earths. So if you believe that we are undergoing a green and digital transformation, guess who has the lion share of the essential raw materials for this new economy? That is one strength (of Australia).\nSecond, Australia has been, and I believe will continue to be, a strong proponent for international law and for the peaceful resolution of disputes. Fortunately, Australia has no territorial disputes with any country in Southeast Asia. That makes it easier. In fact, Australia has supported the use of third-party dispute settlement mechanisms where possible and in fact the example which I want to cite is the resolution of the long-standing maritime boundary dispute that Australia had with Timor-Leste. Originally, this was stuck, there was deadlock, and it was a huge missed opportunity. But in fact, the resolution turned out to be the first actual worked example of compulsory conciliation under UNCLOS. I want to congratulate Australia for doing so, and settling this, and setting an example for the future.\nMy third reason for highlighting Australia\u2019s value proposition is that Australia has always been a firm advocate for free trade and has been an active participant in the regional economic architecture. Again, let me cite examples\u2014 the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership; the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership which includes all 10 ASEAN countries plus China, Japan, ROK, Australia and New Zealand; and now the ongoing work on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, as well as the various digital economy agreements (DEAs) including the one that we signed between Australia and Singapore.\nAustralia and Singapore were trailblazers in signing the landmark Green Economy Agreement in October last year. So my point is that Australia, due to its own natural heritage and its own approach to international law, resolving disputes, and its approach and its behaviour in pursuing multilateralism and signing agreements and sticking to that, this has made Australia an ideal and mutually beneficial partner for all of us in Southeast Asia.\nAustralia\u2019s Role in Southeast Asia\nHere I would like to highlight that Southeast Asia is not just a crossroads. Southeast Asia on its own merits has a population of 670 million persons, which by the way that makes us by population larger than the EU. Southeast Asia is cumulatively the fifth largest economy in the world with a combined GDP currently of, in slightly in excess of US$3 trillion, and this number will double if not quadruple within the next two, maximum three decades. We are now seeing a burst of entrepreneurial energy in Southeast Asia, and it is home to many innovative high growth companies and digital unicorns. Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing digital markets. We believe the digital economy in Southeast Asia will grow by three times and will be worth more than US$300 billion by 2025. That is just a couple of years from now.\nASEAN also happens to be a firm believer in free trade and a key economic partner for many countries. ASEAN is already Australia\u2019s second largest trading partner after China, and it is the third largest export market after China and Japan. In fact, it is not implausible to believe that ASEAN could very well become Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, just as ASEAN has displaced the EU as China\u2019s largest trading partner since 2020.\nAustralia knows that Singapore has always been a keen advocate for Australia\u2019s engagement with Southeast Asia. Australia was ASEAN\u2019s first Dialogue Partner, and subsequently elevated relations with ASEAN to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in October 2021. Australia recently concluded negotiations for an upgraded ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA in February. The 50th anniversary of ASEAN-Australia Dialogue Relations next year will create even more opportunities for cooperation.\nSo I am glad that Australia is already looking at ways to step up its engagement of Southeast Asia, not just for short-term political or commercial advantage but because of careful, reasoned long-term analysis (that) shows opportunity and alignment between Australia and Southeast Asia.\nSingapore-Australia Partnership\nLet me now to turn to zoom in specifically to the bilateral relationship between Australia and Singapore and suggest three ways in which we can take our relationship forward.\nFirst, Singapore can work with Australia as a pathfinder for Australia\u2019s broader engagement of the region. We are already leading the way. The Singapore-Australia bilateral DEA which we signed in 2020 and our landmark Green Economy Agreement which we signed last year. Singapore looks forward to working with Australia to support its ambition to be one of the top three exporters of hydrogen to Asia by 2030. As we push ahead on clean energy and enhanced digital connectivity, I believe we can work together to improve the resilience of the subsea infrastructure.\nSecond, Singapore and Australia can leverage our bilateral cooperation as a template for Australia\u2019s engagement of Southeast Asia. I have already mentioned the Digital and Green Economy Agreements and these can serve as models for Australia\u2019s engagement across Southeast Asia. Our work at the bilateral level has already paved the way for similar principles to be adopted at the multilateral level, including regional economic architecture such as the RCEP, the CPTPP and the IPEF which I mentioned earlier.\nWithin ASEAN, we are commencing negotiations on an ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement that will help to maximise the opportunities to tap into the expanding digital economies, narrow the digital divide in our societies and increase interoperability between Southeast Asia and Australia. This is another fertile area where I believe Australia can play a major role.\nThird, Singapore can serve as a hub and financing centre for Australia's expanding economic engagement of Southeast Asia. Singapore, if you look at the map just now, is right in the heart of Southeast Asia. We are well-positioned and we are a welcome and safe harbour for Australian companies and startups as they begin their first step of globalisation by making that step into Southeast Asia. In fact, I believe we have about 200 global and local accelerators in Singapore currently.\nThe green economyhas also continued to create new and exciting business opportunities for companies in areas including energy, infrastructure, green financing, carbon services and carbon credits. Currently, there are over 70 organisations in Singapore provide carbon-related services. This is probably the highest concentration in Southeast Asia. Singapore is working on enabling pathways for decarbonisation and exploring partnerships with many countries, including obviously Australian businesses, on R&D in this field. Just as there has been a global trend to re-shore, regionalise and diversify existing production and supply chains in order to increase resilience and food security, Australia pops up again as the obvious, preferred partner.\nThe point is, Singapore is well-positioned to host the advanced, high value-added manufacturing operations, and to serve as a supply chain control centre and logistics and procurement hub for Australian businesses serving Southeast Asia as a whole.\nAn Open and Inclusive Regional Architecture\nI believe if we can make progress on all these areas, we will have a stronger and more resilient region for all of us. But beyond that, an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture is the best way forward for all countries, big or small, to have more room to manoeuvre, more strategic latitude, and for us to be able to grow and prosper individually and collectively. We hope that other external partners engage constructively with Southeast Asia on our own merits, and not just through the prism of major power competition. A stable and prosperous Southeast Asia offers significant value for the rest of the world. I want to end by making the point that Australia is the ideal and most naturally aligned partner on this endeavour.\nWe welcome the complementary and overlapping arrangements which will give everybody a stake in peace, prosperity and success of Southeast Asia. And all that we have been working on together with Australia has the potential to be regionalised, to be multilateralised and to be a template for peace and prosperity for the future.\nConclusion\nLet me just conclude by offering you a view from a tiny city state in the heart of Southeast Asia, that we are very optimistic about Australia, your inherent strengths, your engagement of our region, and that even as we deal with these geostrategic challenges and the digital and green economy, Australia is at the heart of it all. Thank you very much.\nQ&A\nQuestion 1: I was just wondering, you referenced the analogy about the house on stilts and the asymmetrical balance within the region. How do you see the concept of ASEAN Centrality fitting into that and how would the region work towards achieving a more equitable balance within ASEAN Centrality?\nQuestion 2: I have one question about Singapore, specifically about maritime security in the region. You have a substantive capability for maritime security so what do you think about Singapore\u2019s role in maintaining the region\u2019s stability especially for maritime security and do you have any comment on how the relationship with Australia can do anything for maritime security in the region?\nMinister: The first question on ASEAN Centrality, let me get to the heart of it. If you look at the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia were arenas for proxy battles. You saw certainly a case of (this) even in Vietnam, in ROK, this combination of both a fight for nationalism, independence and this fight between communism and capitalism. I think one lesson which all of us in Southeast Asia have learnt is that we do not intend to allow ourselves to become yet again an arena for proxy battles. So when we say Centrality, the point is to deal with ASEAN on our own merits, to accept the great diversity within ASEAN. If you look at where the 10 countries stand, for instance in terms of their closeness or alignment of relationships, business and political interests with the superpowers, we are all going to be slightly different but none of us wants to be captured and to be caught in the extremes or to be forced to make binary choices. To the extent that, at least for now, all superpowers say they believe in ASEAN Centrality and they are not trying to divide us and split us. I think that is positive. But of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. But that is a key point for ASEAN Centrality.\nOn maritime security, that is another huge and dangerous question. Maybe let me take a step back and say that for both Australia and for all of us in Southeast Asia, keeping our maritime routes, both land and sea, open and secure, is a high priority. For Singapore, our trade volume is three times our GDP. Keeping those routes \u2013 the air and sea lanes of communication \u2013 open is critical, and I believe Australia shares that same sensitivity.\nThe other point, and this relates to UNCLOS, (is) freedom of navigation, not by grace or by permission but as a right. The moment a ship leaves (a) port, asserting freedom of navigation (means) that ship can go to anywhere else in the world. This is very unlike a train or a car or even flights. That sacred right for freedom of navigation for ships, and given Southeast Asia\u2019s geographical position, is crucial. So it is both a matter of keeping trade lanes open, insisting on the primacy of UNCLOS, and keeping an open and inclusive trade and economic architecture through Southeast Asia and beyond. Certainly I can speak for Singapore and, at least in my interactions with Australia, we are exactly on the same page.\nQuestion 3: Could you please reflect on whether there is an endogenous and a homogenous security architecture in the Southeast Asian region besides the one that is provided by economics? Thank you.\nQuestion 4: Thanks very much Minister, thanks for being with us. It is great to have you and to enjoy your insightful analysis of the situation that we face in the region today. The hope, as you said is as our own Foreign Minister calls it \u201cstrategic equilibrium\u201d in the region or stabilisation of regional politics in a way that avoids the choices and avoids the problems of the past. The question is of course what steps we might take to have agency in achieving strategic equilibrium. You enumerated some of our (Australia\u2019s) assets but Southeast Asia has assets and ASEAN Centrality is accepted as a norm. You have agency, clearly, in the way Indonesia managed the G20 Summit last year. What steps can Southeast Asia, if you want to venture what steps can Australia take to achieve strategic equilibrium and stability in the region?\nMinister: Both questions are related to the similar theme and I like your putting me on the spot. Let us first take a step back and say let us define what is in the national interest of Australia and the rest of us in Southeast Asia. Number one, we need peace. Without peace prevailing, especially for us in Southeast Asia, we cannot focus on the investments in infrastructure, in connectivity, in green and the digital transformation which is needed. So the first thing is just avoiding hot conflict and avoiding becoming an arena for proxy battles. I would say that is the first hygiene factor.\nThe second thing which all of us need is, internally and domestically, each of us needs to be united, to be successful, and to have a clear economic blueprint as to what we need to do to boot ourselves up into the new economy. This is not foreign policy, this is domestic economic policy and every country has to do that calculation for itself because it is going to be different. Again the point to understand about Southeast Asia is the great diversity. If you look at our per capita GDPs, I do not think any other regional group has the variance that we have. If you look at political systems, we range from absolute monarchies to a variety of coup arrangements and democracies in between. The point is, get our own house in order.\nThe third step \u2013 we believe that in order to achieve peace and in order to attract investments, we want an open and inclusive security and economic architecture. What that means is that if any superpower comes to us and says \u201cwe want you to exclude the other\u201d in a variety of diplomatic niceties, the answer would be, \u201cWhy should we exclude anyone?\u201d The more the merrier, more trading partners, more investors, more options, more choices. (It is important) to understand that we want to keep Southeast Asia open and inclusive.\nThe fourth step is to insist (on) \u2013 and I mentioned the primacy of UNCLOS just now, but the deeper habit behind that \u2013 adherence to international law, the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful resolution of disputes \u2013 these are things which are essential for small countries or even medium-sized countries who do not yet have the military muscle. We need international law, we need these processes and the self-restraint that comes with (them) if we are to have any agency at all.\nFinally, I would say the more we can make common cause with each other \u2013 and this is where Australia comes in because I see it is quite a natural alignment of economic interest, a view on regional architecture and an adherence to international law and the UN Charter. It therefore creates quite a natural partnership between Australia and Southeast Asia. If we can do all these things and I would say the critical period is the next decade. In the next decade we will have answers to a few crucial questions of our time.\nFirst question \u2013 will China overtake America, by whatever metric you want to use? Next question, what is going to be the impact of this digital revolution, AI, robotics \u2013 a whole transformation of the factors of production, to use a Marxist concept \u2013 how is this going to play out? Also, within the next decade, will the world succeed in making a dent on climate change and carbon emissions and this whole transformation in renewable anergy? And if that is not enough, the other answer I think we will get within the next decade is the revolution in biotechnology, genomic medicine, and the fact that it is now possible to sequence the whole genome of each of us here within the next decade for less than a hundred dollars. What does that mean for life and medicine and society? Our choices that we make in the next decade are going to be critical and this is a wonderful time to be alive. But I do believe, on an optimistic note, we play our cards right, all of us will be able to maintain agency, avoid invidious choices, remain open to science and technology and sound economics, to make common cause and to operate on the basis of international law. I guess diplomats have to be optimistic, and I remain optimistic.\nQuestion 5: Minister you talked towards the end about this very refreshing timeframe of the next ten years and these wide challenges. I would like to bring you, if you would allow me, to the narrower strategist\u2019s preoccupations. Sorry to put you on the spot, but what keeps you awake at night? If the region or the world were to fall off the rails, what would be the top two nightmare things for Singapore that might happen that keeps you awake at night?\nQuestion 6: We have not talked about Myanmar. We talked about the centrality of ASEAN \u2013 I think what is happening there is deeply corrosive to the centrality of ASEAN. Australia has played a prominent role in the past in the (Comprehensive) Cambodian Peace Accord (Agreements), in resolving the East Timor crisis, but it could only do so when it collaborated closely with Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries and Singapore. Is there something we can do about Myanmar, what does the future hold for Myanmar and ASEAN?\nQuestion 7: ASEAN is working on the ASEAN Vision 2045. How confident are you that we will still have ASEAN by that year?\nMinister: The easiest question is your question. I am confident ASEAN will still be around. I am not saying that, again, for diplomatic reasons but just through the analysis which I shared just now in the speech. If you look in terms of our inherent advantages, if you look in terms of our growth potential, if you look in terms of the demographics, if you look in terms of the natural resources, if you assess our potential in very great partnership with Australia, there is every reason to be optimistic about ASEAN.\nNow, the complicating factor, and there will be, is if you were to ask me how many members will be in ASEAN in 2045. The answer is, I hope at least 11. But it relates to John\u2019s question. What Myanmar illustrates is that if a country cannot get even to the first base of achieving national identity and a modicum of cohesion amidst diversity, and keeps relying on military force to assert, impose unity and dominance of one rule over the other \u2013 you are never going to get to national development and all this future we are talking about here based on investing in technologies for the next stage of the economy, of uplifting people, training, education, fair opportunities and integrating with the world. Unfortunately, what we are witnessing in Myanmar is not just a coup that is two years old; it is the fact that they have never, unlike the rest of us, been able to achieve that national unity, that basic modicum of consensus to operate the country.\nIf your question is how long is it going to take for them to get there, I do not know how long. What is happening there is a tragedy and people are paying in blood for that tragedy. The implication for ASEAN is that there will be a member, for a long time, who is not fulfilling its primary responsibility to its own people and therefore not able to play a constructive role in ASEAN, and actually not even able to harvest these bountiful opportunities that are unfolding in front of Southeast Asia for next two decades.\nThe related question is what should we do about it? And here I want to caution that I do not believe in external interference, I do not believe these deep political questions at the domestic level can be answered by any of us. In the end, we do not want to have blood on our hands so I think we need to make sure the actions we take collective and individually do not make the situation worse and do not allow or encourage or enable the military to shed more blood for their own narrow parochial interests. Having said that, we also must not get ahead of ourselves and say somehow we can go in there, wave a magic wand and create a functioning democracy. That is not what the history of Southeast Asia has taught us. It may take a long gestation time but we will need patience, we will need to signal disapproval, we will need to make sure we do not make things worse, we will need to make sure we do not have blood on our hands, but we will also need some strategic patience.\nSo what will happen by 2045? Time will tell. I hope that problem will be solved way before that. But if you think about the time, the 70, 80 years in which they have struggled, will they be able to solve that in another 20 years? I do not know.\nYour question on what keeps me awake \u2013 number one is I do worry about that fuse in Taiwan. I do worry about being forced to make invidious choices and sometimes it is hard to say which one will jump first to force us to make a choice. I do worry, and this is now at the domestic level, if people do not understand both the enormous strategic challenges and opportunities that are unfolding in front of us in the next 10 to 20 years, and if political leaders are unable to communicate that and at least get sufficient level of consensus and commitment to reforming education, upgrading skills, building new safety nets. In the same way, the last industrial revolution needed the corrective of a welfare state and moves in retirement, health and education. All of us are going to need to do fundamental self-surgery on our political and economic domestic systems. I do worry that if that is not handled properly you end up with another (similar) period. The parallel I worry about is whether we are in a period similar to before World War One or even in the interregnum between the First World War and the Second World War, when strategic questions were not addressed and you have the Great Depression and the rise of populism on the Left and on the Right.\nThese are things that I do worry about \u2013 a sudden cataclysm in Northeast Asia, a failure to make that transition domestically, and then a failure for us to avoid the mistakes of the past. Therefore I want to keep Southeast Asia united despite the diversity, avoid being an arena for proxy wars, and instead focus on making it a zone of great opportunity. Again, as I said, I just want to say to Australia, sometimes just take a deep breath, step back, realise you are truly the Lucky Country and even more so for this brave new world that is emerging. Stick to your own values and your own diplomatic habits, it will be a good day.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s Keynote Remarks at Australian National University\u2019s Southeast Asia Regional Geopolitical Update in Canberra, 1 May 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

        "content": "Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles: Today, we have had a really productive meeting of the Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee. At its heart, what is completely clear is the deep affection which is felt between our two countries, and that has really been embodied in the rapport which exists between the six Ministers who have been participating in the meeting today. We really welcome the involvement of our Singapore counterparts, welcome you to Australia today and thank you for the participation in today\u2019s meeting.\nAs we have discussed many topics, what has become really clear is that we really do live in a world with great strategic complexity and significant strategic threat. We want to play our parts, as two nations, in creating pathways for peace within that world. But as we look forward and we look at the uncertainty of the future, one matter becomes manifestly clear, and that is the importance of the friendship that we have between our two countries, and the importance of making sure that we make this relationship even deeper into the future.\nThe relationship is unique. From a defence point of view, Singapore and Australia have a very specific and close and unique relationship embodied in the way in which Singapore does so much of its training in Australia. Singapore has as much presence in respect of defence in our country as any other nation in the world. That is something that we really welcome. We understand the significance of that to Singapore, but we really appreciate it from the perspective of Australia. We love having members of the Singaporean Armed Forces coming to our country to do their training and we have looked at ways in which we can expand that into the future. Where there are issues in respect of facilitating that, we are working really closely in terms of trying to resolve those.\nWe have also looked at other issues within the context of our relationship, and there has been a conversation around Australia\u2019s supply of energy to Singapore, including the supply of gas. We want to make clear that we regard Singapore\u2019s energy security as profoundly important in terms of Australia\u2019s national interests. We made very clear to our Singaporean counterparts that Australia will continue to be a completely reliable partner in terms of the provision of energy into the Singaporean market and that includes the provision of gas. This is really important in terms of our bilateral relationship. It is obviously important, therefore, in terms of our broad interests within the region, and the significance of our relationship with Singapore in terms of our broader interests within the region. We were very pleased to be able to have that conversation today. As we approach the 10th anniversary in 2025 of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), we look forward over the course of the next month to when our two leaders will be having their own Leaders\u2019 Meeting, and that very much formed part of the backdrop of the discussions today. As we enter into the next Leaders\u2019 Meeting between Australia and Singapore, we do so with a lot of optimism about the future of our bilateral relationship.\nMinister Vivian Balakrishnan: Thank you. Let me thank Richard, Penny and Don for that very warm welcome for Eng Hen and Kim Yong. This is the 13th Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee. I was just reflecting \u2013 I think I have attended almost half of all those meetings. So, when I stand here and say that this has been a long-term, consistent relationship based on mutual trust and a proven track record of cooperation, I mean it and I have the years in service to say that with utmost conviction. You are right \u2013 by 2025, we would have had 10 years of CSP. You know, the word \u201cstrategic\u201d is bandied around a lot nowadays. But when Singapore and Australia agree on something, we have complied with it, both the spirit and the letter, and it has come along wonderfully over the years. We will also be celebrating 60 years of diplomatic ties in 2025. I think at a time like this where the world is in an unsettled, volatile, and uncertain phase, it becomes even more critical. Obviously we are different in size, in location, but we are complementary, we trust each other, we are absolutely reliable, we fulfil our commitments to one another and the level of trust which Australia has demonstrated to us, and I believe on a mutual basis, means all the more reason we need to double down on this. Thank you once again for this session.\nMinister Penny Wong: Thanks very much to Minister Vivian, to Eng Hen and Kim Yong, thank you very much for the spirit of our discussion today. As we discussed, you are one of our closest partners, (and) it has been a great pleasure to host you here in Canberra. The Committee has reaffirmed in the discussions today, an ambitious agenda. As Minister Vivian said, we have a CSP. We have done a lot of work in the context of that partnership but we envisage \u2013 on the Australian side, as we go forward \u2013 an even closer and deeper strategic relationship given the circumstances. We are very pleased to have the discussions we had today.\nObviously, we are linked to Singapore for many reasons. Historically, I spent a fair bit of time there when I was younger, so we are linked by geography, we are linked by our people, and by choice. We share a region and we share a future. Our friendship is underpinned by a great deal of strategic consistency, by similar and complementary shared economic interests and a shared vision for an open, stable and inclusive region.\nI just wanted to add one point, because I think Richard has covered a lot of what I wanted to say in the opening, but we have the tenth anniversary of the CSP in 2025. So, what we do want to do is to ensure that we work towards the next iteration in a way that enables us in 2025, to have an even closer relationship, and a more ambitious and dynamic next iteration of the partnership. Thank you all for making the journey to Australia, and we hope we can reciprocate in the near future.\nMinister Ng Eng Hen: I will make some comments on defence that Deputy Prime Minister Marles made. First, let me thank Mr Marles for his kind words. We had a very productive meeting, we are very thankful for the progress we made under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) about ten years ago. We want to thank the Labour government under Prime Minister Albanese and his Ministers here: Deputy Prime Minister Marles, Minister Penny Wong and Minister Don Farrell for supporting our training here \u2013 we have a big footprint.\nEvery year, thousands of our Singaporean young men doing their National Service experience your wonderful bushlands and your weather, and they go back with very fond memories. And it is only possible because of the affection that Deputy Prime Minister talked about. The affection of the officials, the affection of the people who put up with our military training \u2013 whether it is Shoalwater Bay, Pearce, or Oakey. We thank you for that.\nIt was also very productive because we are looking forward, with more training opportunities bilaterally, as well as for us if you allow us to train here. We understand your processes, there are some developments in the CSP that are delayed, but we respect your processes and try to be helpful wherever we can.\nI want to end off by saying that another aspect that we talked about during this Ministerial Committee was of the way forward and the complex environment. And for that, we believe that Australia can play a bigger role in our region, for Australia\u2019s vested interest is in Asia. It is an Asian country, not only just an Indo-Pacific country, but an Asian country. We would welcome Australian ships and planes through our bases, and ultimately when your submarines are ready, we would welcome them to call on our ports, we will facilitate. We believe that Australia adds to regional security in ASEAN and beyond. We look forward to these very, very positive aspects, and thank you once again for your friendship and your confidence in each other.\nMinister Don Farrell: Thank you, everyone. Thank you for our Ministers from Singapore coming to join us today. I first met Minister Vivian when we both had the responsibility for water, a nice 10 or 11 years ago, and we have had a very good relationship. I first went to Singapore in the 1970s as a student and continue to go there and enjoy it. But thank you for coming to Australia today.\nOne of the things that happens this year is that we celebrate 20 years of our Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore. Singapore is our closest friend in Southeast Asia, and we see great opportunities to build upon the past and build upon those complementary features of our economy, whether it be in the digital space \u2013 and we have got a very progressive agreement with Singapore in the digital space - whether it be in the green space. Australia intends to be a renewable superpower, and we believe that we can be great partners with Singapore.\nOn this year of the 20th anniversary, we think that there are even more ambitious things that we can do together. At the World Trade Organization (WTO), we have no better friend than Singapore in terms of building a sensible, rules-based order for trade. We both share an ambition to make trade fair in the world, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleague, Minister Gan, to build on that wonderful relationship that we have had over that twenty years. Thank you.\nMinister Gan Kim Yong: Thank you. First, let me thank my Australian hosts Minister Don Farrell, Deputy Prime Minister Marles and Foreign Minister Wong. It has been a great opportunity for me to be here to discuss various issues of concern between our two countries. As Don pointed out, we celebrated our 20th anniversary of our Singapore-Australia FTA (Free Trade Agreement). We even cut the cake, but I am still waiting for the cake to be delivered. But I think it is an important milestone. This Free Trade Agreement has formed the foundation for many of our collaboration that have emerged over the years. As Don pointed out, we had a digital economy agreement. Last October, we signed the world's first green economy agreement. These agreements have now become the pathfinders for many bilateral as well as regional collaboration in both digital and green areas. So, I think there is great scope for us to continue to work together. As the world economic landscape becomes more challenging going forward, it is even more important for like-minded partners like Australia and Singapore to work together to see how we can strengthen bilateral collaboration and regional cooperation. These will include areas not just (in) green and digital economy, but also supply chain resilience, particularly in the energy security area. I am very happy to note DPM (Richard Marles)\u2019s comment about Australia committing to be a reliable partner in our energy security considerations. It is important for us to continue to work together, and I look forward to working with both teams to see how we can iron out the details. I think there are a lot of opportunities for us, whether in a digital or green economy, as well as supply chain resilience arrangements. At the same time in a regional arena, whether it is IPEF (Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity), World Trade Organisation, or CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership), we have always worked very closely with one another to ensure that we discuss with one another and to have consultation with one another, to ensure that we are able to bring forward and to strengthen regional cooperation. I certainly look forward to meeting Don in (the) future to discuss further our areas of bilateral cooperation. Thank you.\nDaniel Hurst (Guardian Australia): On the trade front, Singapore was one of the countries that signed up as a third party to the World Trade Organization disputes that Australia initiated against China's actions on Australian barley and on Australian wine. Does Singapore believe that those trade measures were coercive in nature? And should there be a reason for China not to be accepted into the CPTPP?\nMinister Gan Kim Yong: Thank you very much. Singapore's interests as the third party is really to better understand how the process is being conducted as a member of the World Trade Organization. It is also in our interest to see how we can strengthen the dispute resolution mechanism. That is the primary reason why we are involved in the World Trade Organization\u2019s dispute settlement as a third party observer. On the CPTPP, as we have mentioned, it is a consensus-based approach for ascension processes, and Singapore welcomes economies who are able to meet the high standard that is required under CPTPP and have demonstrated the ability to comply with rules that are set down in CPTPP.\nBrandon How (InnovationAus): Question for Minister Gan and Minister Farrell. Note that Singapore introduced the enterprise innovation scheme, which has a lot of generous incentives for research and development in Australia as well as very big expenses in supporting and encouraging R&D expenditure. Given the collaboration ongoing in the green and digital space, what opportunities do you see for closer integration and collaboration between the two startup ecosystems?\nMinister Don Farrell: Australia, as I said earlier, at our meeting, of course, continues to be the lucky country. One of the things that we have an ample supply of is all of the critical minerals, and for that matter, rare earths that are going to decarbonise not only Australia's economy, not only Singapore's economy, but the world's economy. Australia has either the largest or the second largest reserves of all of those resources that are going to allow us to make that transition from a fossil fuel economy to the decarbonised renewable economy. One of the ways in which we can get the maximum benefit from the agreements that you are talking about is to ensure that we are working together as two countries committed to decarbonising our economy. The thing about critical minerals is that, well, if you look at say, an iron ore mine, if you go up to northern Western Australia, you can see an iron ore for as far as the eye can see that red, red dust. Critical minerals are actually quite different. They are much smaller deposits, they are much deeper down, they are going to be more expensive to extract, and they are not going to last as long as an iron ore mine will. That is just one example I think of the opportunities that we both have in that green space.\nMinister Gan Kim Yong: Maybe I (will) just give a few comments on the innovation that you asked about. In fact, Singapore and Australia have several programmes ongoing on innovation on the research and development, and our Enterprise Singapore has set up several Global Innovation Alliance around the world, including Australia, to encourage small and medium enterprises to embark on innovation, as well as collaboration with one another to better understand the market needs and to do product development. So it is an area that we are very keen to explore with Australia. In fact, this afternoon, I am going to visit a hydrogen testing facility to look at how we can better manage hydrogen as an alternative energy source. These are areas that we will continue to explore how we can collaborate both on the digital side as well as on the green economy to bring benefit to both countries.\nDominic Gianni (AAP): On the gas supply, why did you feel it necessary to reassure Singapore that Australia will be able to attend to their energy security? Was our reputation harmed by their quiet quitting comments that came out of Japan and just, if I might, Senator Wong, can I please ask for an update on the PNG (Papua New Guinea) defence agreement? I know the negotiations were scheduled to be concluded this month.\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles: I will just answer simply in relation to the first question. We spoke about Australia\u2019s role as an energy supplier to Singapore because it is a really central part of the bilateral relationship. Australia\u2019s supplies are a significant proportion of Singapore\u2019s energy and it is unremarkable for us to say that that is a relationship which is beneficial to both countries, that we value it. We value that part of it which provides the energy security to Singapore and we value being a reliable supplier of gas going forward. So that is the context in which those remarks were made.\nMinister Penny Wong: First, as you know, we are appreciative of Prime Minister Marape\u2019s strong support for this negotiation, and we will continue to work with PNG on the details of those negotiations. I am sure we will talk to you when we are able to talk about that.\nJonathan Pearlman (ST): Question for the Singaporean ministers. There was a comment about allowing Australian submarines through Singapore and I wonder if that would extend to nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS Agreement? And just generally, what the view from Singapore is on those nuclear-powered submarine acquisitions?\nMinister Ng Eng Hen: Well, you will not be the first. We have the US (United States) nuclear-powered submarines that called at Changi Naval Base.\nStephen Dziedzic (ABC): A question for the Singaporean delegation. You have recently seen a ramping up of tensions around the Philippines with the announcement of new US bases in the region and recently, a clash between a Chinese naval coast guard vessel and a Filipino vessel. Are you concerned about tensions in the South China Sea?\nMinister Vivian Balakrishnan: For both Australia and Singapore, the relationship between the United States and China is absolutely vital. If you look at our strategic position, if you look at our economic interest, for both Australia and Singapore, the ideal world is one in which a modus vivendi is achieved between Washington and Beijing. Our vital relationships with each of them are based on a stable rules-based regime, an open and inclusive Southeast Asia and to create a balance of power which maximises the options for all of us much smaller countries, and that both the United States and China have a stake in our success and prosperity. That will be the ideal world. So, I think it is worth making that as the general starting line.\nHaving said that, we also recognise that we do not control the agenda in Washington and Beijing. I think it is going to take some time before a sufficient level of strategic trust is built up between the two of them, and for relations to be on an even keel. That would give all of us much relief and a sense of stability. Having said that, from a Southeast Asian perspective, I think all of us want to ensure that Southeast Asia does not become an arena for proxy wars. We all want to ensure the sea lanes, freedom of navigation, is achieved as a right under UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and not by permission or by grace of any power. We want all powers, not just the superpowers, but all middle powers \u2013I would include Australia in that \u2013 to have free access and opportunities in Southeast Asia and in the sea lanes and in the air lines of communication. Obviously, we do view any altercations, collisions or incidents at sea with grave concern.\nThe point here is that we want to head off these situations. Speaking from the point of view of ASEAN, that is why we are continuing our negotiations on the Code of Conduct. It will not resolve the disputes over sovereignty, but it can help build confidence by lowering the thresholds for conflict or for escalatory actions. That is what we hope for, and certainly in the case of Australia and Singapore, and (Minister) Penny can add to that, we all want a rules-based regime. We want an open and inclusive regional architecture. I think what is special about the relationship between Australia and Singapore is that we both see the critical need for a rules-based regime, for compliance with international law, for compliance with the principles of the UN (United Nations) Charter, and we see this in exactly the same way. There were some questions just now related to defence and economy. It is worth remembering that the defence relationship between Australia and Singapore goes back many decades, in our case, even before independence. We have the Five-Power Defence Arrangements, and I have lost count of how many Singaporean youth have spent time training down here. This is a unique arrangement. When we say that we believe Australia is a constructive partner, it is absolutely sincere. Even on AUKUS, if I could speak not from a military perspective, but from a strategic perspective, insofar as it contributes constructively to regional security, we are in support of it. We are comfortable with all the three partners within AUKUS because with each of them, we have had long-term relationships. That is why I think we are able to work together and I want to make the point about that - complementarity and that trust is unique. Long may we nurture and double down on it.\nMinister Penny Wong: Hear, hear. When we speak about our closeness and the strategic trust. These are not matters only of history, of affection, of geography. They are also a perspective, a shared perspective, or very similar perspectives, about our interests and what matters to our interests and Minister Vivian, more eloquently than I, has outlined those. I just want to make three points. Our interests are very aligned because we understand, given who we are, the importance of the multilateral system and rules, and we acknowledge in particular, that Singapore has been clear about, its position on Ukraine, and has articulated its understanding on why all states need to push back on the breach of the UN Charter. Secondly, we, as Minister Vivian has said, understand the importance of rules to our national interest and to stability. In that context, particularly, given our location, UNCLOS matters. It matters to Singapore and it matters to us, and it matters to the region and it matters to the stability of the region. The third point is where the Minister started. We have spoken about the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region in which we live. Whether it is AUKUS, our commitment to ASEAN centrality, our economic engagement with the region, (and) all of our work that we do, that is the focus Australia has. We have also spoken about the importance of guardrails in the relationship between the US and China. Minister Vivian uses a different formulation, modus vivendi, but they are essentially seeking the same thing, that is, we all want those powers to ensure that they operate in a way that lessens the chance of miscalculation or escalation and enhances the possibility of continued stability and peace.\nStephen Dziedzic (ABC): Just to follow up on AUKUS, you spoke just then about the trust between Singapore and AUKUS nations. And those reservoirs are something you have talked about before. 18 months in, what is your current assessment of the regional response to AUKUS? What is your message to countries like Indonesia that have publicly expressed concerns about the way that AUKUS might undermine norms of non-proliferation or regional stability more broadly?\nMinister Vivian Balakrishnan: Let me say I cannot speak on behalf of my neighbours. I do not want to overstate the case. I speak on behalf of Singapore and how Singapore relates to Australia, and I choose my words carefully. As long as AUKUS contributes constructively to regional peace and stability, it is a good thing. Do we trust the individual partners of AUKUS? In the case of Singapore, we have got long standing relationships with each of them. That is why we have, in a sense, not expressed any reservations. Penny took the trouble to call me, and I think Richard called Eng Hen as well, before the second round of announcements, to underline Australia's commitment to the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency. I have absolutely no reason to doubt Australia's commitment on this front.\nPhoto Caption: Joint Press Conference at the 13th Meeting of the Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee (SAJMC) in Canberra, 1 May 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Family photo at the 13th Meeting of the Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee (SAJMC) in Canberra, 1 May 2023\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

The Ministers acknowledged the close friendship and ambitious partnership between Australia and Singapore, underpinned by shared interests in an open, stable and prosperous region, where sovereignty and international law are respected. The Ministers acknowledged that the strong partnership between Australia and Singapore, anchored by strategic trust and deep cooperation, is even more important at a time of increasing geostrategic uncertainty and complexity in the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe Ministers recalled the Joint Declaration on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) signed in 2015 and welcomed the significant progress made under all six pillars of the CSP as set out in the 10-year CSP Roadmap. They reaffirmed the strong commitment by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the October 2022 Annual Leaders\u2019 Meeting to continue to strengthen the CSP. The Ministers tasked officials to begin work on developing the agenda for the next chapter of the CSP ahead of its 10th anniversary in 2025.\nEconomics, Trade and InvestmentThe Ministers welcomed the strong trade and investment partnership between Australia and Singapore. They noted that both countries are among each other\u2019s top trading partners and that bilateral trade volumes continued to grow, underpinned by the upgraded Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) and the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA). The Ministers looked forward to the 20th anniversary of SAFTA in July 2023 and acknowledged that it remained a modern and forward-looking agreement.The Ministers noted progress under the Australia \u2013 Singapore Supply Chains Working Group including through bilateral discussions on food, energy, connectivity and crisis response. Recalling the agreement between the Prime Ministers in October 2022 to begin work on an Australia-Singapore Food Pact, the Ministers acknowledged the progress made, including on a simplified model for transhipment of Australian meat products and regionalisation arrangements for animal diseases, and noted opportunities to work together to enhance the resilience of agri-food supply chains and promote agreed principles on sustainable agri-food systems. On energy, connectivity and crisis response, the Ministers were pleased to note good progress in discussions on both sides. The Ministers directed officials to finalise the guiding principles and workplan for the Food Pact before the 2024 Annual Leaders\u2019 Meeting, and continue discussions to strengthen energy security, connectivity and crisis response cooperation.They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which supports and promotesfree trade and open markets and respects the rights of countries to lead their national existence free from external interference, subversion and coercion. The Ministers affirmed their support for the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core, which has underpinned the region\u2019s stability and prosperity for many decades. The Ministers agreed to continue to work closely to strengthen and reform the WTO, and emphasised the importance of implementing all 12th WTO Ministerial Conference outcomes, particularly the commitment to have a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all WTO members by 2024.The Ministers agreed to promote economic integration, investment and liberalisation of goods and services trade through the WTO, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the G20. The Ministers looked forward to advancing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and agreed to work together, and with other partners, to ensure IPEF delivers concrete solutions to shared challenges, including decarbonisation, digital trade and supply chain resilience. The Ministers looked forward to the signing of the upgraded AANZFTA in 2023. The Ministers were also pleased to note the good progress made on implementing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The Ministers welcomed Singapore\u2019s strong leadership during its chairmanship of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) Commission in 2022 and reaffirmed both countries\u2019 continued commitment to the high standards of the CPTPP. The Ministers further noted Australia\u2019s ambition to boost its trade and investment in the region and the importance of Singapore as a key regional hub, and welcomed the appointment of Australia\u2019s Special Envoy Nicholas Moore who is leading the development of Australia\u2019s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040. Singapore and Australia\u2019s joint efforts to participate in regional trade flows ensure that they remain plugged in while maintaining the relevance and economic heft of their region.Foreign Affairs, Defence and SecurityThe Ministers recalled the commitment made by the Prime Ministers in October 2022 to work together to build an Indo-Pacific region of dialogue and cooperation. They recognised that the CSP between Australia and Singapore reinforced regional stability and growth. The Ministers acknowledged the deep and ambitious ASEAN-Australia CSP and agreed that Australia would work with ASEAN to strengthen cooperation on key and emerging areas such as the digital and green economies, and energy security. The Ministers welcomed Australia\u2019s proposal to host a Special Summit to Commemorate the 50th Anniversary of ASEAN-Australia Dialogue Relations in 2024. The Ministers expressed their support for ASEAN centrality and ASEAN\u2011led regional architecture, including the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum, and the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) and reaffirmed the importance of working together to support the practical implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, including through the ASEAN-Australia CSP. The Ministers looked forward to working together to support Timor-Leste to build capacity in line with the objective, criteria-based ASEAN roadmap for Timor-Leste\u2019s accession to ASEAN, which will be adopted at the 42nd ASEAN Summit.The Ministers discussed the need to work with partners in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region to ensure the region remains open, stable and prosperous. They welcomed the Quad\u2019s support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, including the Quad\u2019s agenda to support Indo-Pacific countries\u2019 priorities and needs.The Ministers welcomed the depth and breadth of defence and security cooperation between Singapore and Australia, built over decades and underpinned by a shared commitment to a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They reaffirmed the value of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), which remain a key anchor of peace and stability in the region, and their joint commitment to preserving and enhancing the professional and strategic value of the FPDA. The Ministers expressed their satisfaction with Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 (SAF) training in Australia, including through Exercise Wallaby 2022, Republic of Singapore Air Force detachments, and the joint development of training areas and advanced training facilities in Queensland; and Singapore\u2019s continued support for Australian aircraft and ships in the region. They welcomed steps to increase the complexity of bilateral exercises, most notably Exercise Trident, increasing interoperability between the Australian Defence Force and SAF. They welcomed steps to strengthen cooperation on defence science and technology, logistics, and in the digital and information environments. Australia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence briefed the Ministers on Australia\u2019s Defence Strategic Review.The Ministers underscored their commitment to work together in multilateral fora to support the international rules-based order, including by upholding international law and norms and a strong United Nations system, which protects the sovereignty of all countries in the region. The Ministers reaffirmed the commitment of Australia and Singapore to strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as its cornerstone and to supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s vital role in verifying fulfilment of States\u2019 nuclear non-proliferation obligations. They acknowledged Australia\u2019s commitment to responsible nuclear stewardship and setting the highest non-proliferation standard in relation to its acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines under AUKUS.The Ministers noted the strong ongoing security cooperation, including in the areas of counter\u2011terrorism (CT), cybersecurity and law enforcement. The Ministers noted relevant agencies had shared expertise in forensics, operational science and technology. They affirmed the value of Australia and Singapore\u2019s close engagement on CT issues through the annual bilateral CT dialogue, an important platform to exchange views on managing the evolving terrorism threat. The Ministers noted Australia\u2019s deployment of an Australian liaison officer to Singapore\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Information Facility, a key multilateral counter-terrorism information sharing mechanism in Southeast Asia. They underscored the value of their close bilateral and regional cooperation on cybersecurity issues, including in international cyber discussions at the United Nations. The Ministers called for global adherence to the UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. They also acknowledged the importance of countering the threats of foreign interference as well as disinformation and misinformation.People-to-People The Ministers reflected on the warm and close personal links between Australians and Singaporeans, underpinned by strong links in education and the arts. The Ministers recognised the New Colombo Plan\u2019s success in increasing cultural literacy and personal connections through student exchange, with more than 200 Australian students supported to travel to Singapore in the first three months of 2023, and over 4,000 student grants being awarded for study in Singapore since 2014. The Ministers welcomed the significant bilateral arts and cultural engagement under the Australia Singapore Arts Group (ASAG), and looked forward to continuing cultural cooperation with Australia through ASAG as well as among the cultural institutions of both countries. The Ministers welcomed the renewal of a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2022 between the National Library of Australia and the National Library Board, Singapore.The Ministers welcomed the substantive exchanges between the Australian and Singaporean public services. They commended the productive discussions at the 8th Australia-Singapore Public Service Roundtable (PSR) in April 2023, co-led by Australia\u2019s Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Professor Glyn Davis and Singapore\u2019s Head of Civil Service Leo Yip. During the PSR, both countries shared perspectives on building and sustaining trust in government.Science and InnovationThe Ministers noted the strong collaboration between Australia and Singapore in science, technology and innovation. They acknowledged progress under the new Synchrotron Access Agreement between the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and National University of Singapore, noting that the first call-for-proposals had been well-received. They welcomed cooperation on low emissions technologies under the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Low Emissions Solutions. They reaffirmed both sides\u2019 intent for greater research cooperation enabled by the Master Research Collaboration Agreement (MRCA) signed in October 2022 between the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore (A*STAR) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to implement a five-year Research Industry \u20182+2\u2019 Partnership in the areas of low-emissions technologies, alternative proteins and advanced manufacturing.Digital EconomyThe Ministers affirmed the opportunities presented by the digital economy and the value of collaboration between Australia and Singapore in supporting the growth of the digital economy. The Ministers affirmed their shared commitment in supporting the digital transformation of economies, including bilaterally through the Singapore-Australia Digital Economy Agreement and the implementation of its collaborative projects, as well as through other regional frameworks, in particular the IPEF, and the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce. Green EconomyThe Ministers recalled the commitment of the Prime Ministers to deepen cooperation and accelerate ambitious climate action. They welcomed the progressive work underway to implement the Singapore-Australia Green Economy Agreement (GEA) signed by the trade ministers in October 2022, as part of the new \u2018Green Economy\u2019 pillar of the CSP. The Ministers affirmed the need to work closely together to implement the GEA and deliver practical outcomes that help accelerate efforts to decarbonise economic activities, including the development of green skills. They noted that the growing collaboration across both governments and with business, industry and expert groups was paving the way for trade, investment and commercial opportunities in green sectors. They noted Singapore\u2019s position as a regional hub and Australia\u2019s ambition to become a renewable energy superpower provided a strong basis for advancing collaboration in several sectors, including clean energy, shipping, finance and emerging green technologies. The Ministers agreed to report on the GEA\u2019s progress and key outcomes to the Prime Ministers when they meet later in the year for the Annual Leaders\u2019 Meeting.The Ministers reaffirmed their aim for the GEA to serve as a model for cooperation with other partners to support the global transition to net zero economies, and acknowledged the positive progress made in this regard. Global and Regional DevelopmentsThe Ministers acknowledged that Australia and Singapore faced an era of heightened geostrategic uncertainty and threats to the international rules-based order. The Ministers agreed that all countries, regardless of their size, have a responsibility to contribute to global stability and to resolve disputes peacefully.The Ministers condemned Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression against the people of Ukraine in a gross violation of international law, including the UN Charter. Consistent with UN General Assembly Resolution No. A/RES/ES-11/6 dated 23 February 2023, the Ministers demanded that Russia immediately withdraw its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, and underlined the need to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible. They urged Russia to respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Ministers noted with deep concern the worsening humanitarian, security and economic situation in Myanmar, including the military\u2019s increasing use of violence against civilians.

        "content": "Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong delivered pre-recorded remarks at the opening ceremony of the Understanding China-Greater Bay Area Dialogue organised by the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy in Guangzhou on 19 April 2023. The theme of the Dialogue is \u201cChinese Modernisation and New Opportunities for the World\u201d.\nThe full text is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n19 APRIL 2023\nMr Chairman\nLadies and Gentlemen\nThank you for inviting me to speak at your distinguished Dialogue.\nChina\u2019s development has been phenomenal since it opened to the outside world more than four decades ago. I have seen it with my own eyes. I first visited Beijing in 1971 and have been to many parts of China since. China is now the world\u2019s second largest economy, with a share of global GDP at over 18%. As China exits from the Covid-19 pandemic, we expect its economy to grow stronger and lead global growth for the next few years.\nSingapore\u2019s participation in China\u2019s development\nChina\u2019s development has benefitted the world, in particular, countries in the region.\nSingapore has been an early and steadfast partner of China in its modernisation journey.\na.Mr Lee Kuan Yew initiated our first Government-to-Government project, the Suzhou Industrial Park, in 1994. This proved hugely successful, having been ranked the best economic development zone in China for seven years running.\nb.I proposed the second Government-to-Government project, the Tianjin Eco-City, to Premier Wen Jiabao in 2007. The project focuses on ecological protection and sustainability, in line with China\u2019s priority on sustainable development.\nc.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong accepted China\u2019s proposal for our third Government-to-Government project, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI) in 2015. This project ties in nicely with China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor under the CCI established a new trade route between China\u2019s inland Western provinces and Southeast Asia.\nd.There is also another large-scale project, the Guangzhou Knowledge City. This is a private sector-led and government-supported project to help transform Guangdong\u2019s economy.\nMy point is this. At different stages of China\u2019s development, Singapore, under different Prime Ministers, has sought to identify China\u2019s prevailing priorities and map out the areas where our interests converge. This has allowed both countries to achieve \u201cwin-win\u201d outcomes.\nOpportunities for ASEAN\nLikewise, ASEAN countries are well-positioned to seize the opportunities from China\u2019s continued growth for \u201cwin-win\u201d outcomes.\na.ASEAN is home to 680 million people, with a growing middle class and vast consumer market.\nb.Collectively, ASEAN is the 5th largest economy in the world.\nc.ASEAN and China are now each other\u2019s biggest trading partners.\nd.Two-way investment flow exceeds US$340 billion.\nThere is still potential for ASEAN and China to deepen our ties.\na.China was ASEAN\u2019s first Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partner in 2002. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) became a pathfinder for ASEAN\u2019s subsequent FTAs with other dialogue partners, as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), currently the largest FTA in the world.\nb.ASEAN and China are now negotiating an upgrade of the ACFTA. I urge both sides to secure a substantive upgrade. This will pave the way for deeper regional economic integration and a stronger rules-based multilateral trading system.\nASEAN and China can also expand their cooperation to emerging sectors, such as in the digital economy.\na.The size of China\u2019s digital economy more than doubled in the last six years. It now makes up about 40% of its GDP.\nb.Similarly, ASEAN is the fastest growing internet market in the world.\nc.There is scope for both sides to cooperate in this area, including through inter-operability of e-commerce platforms and further facilitation of cross-border trade, among others.\nKey challenges to China\u2019s development\nHowever, the positive relations between ASEAN and China are overcast by the looming strategic tensions between the US and China. The US-China relationship is critically important to peace and stability in Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world.\na.Regrettably, the US and China now regard one another as strategic rivals. They have differing positions over a wide range of issues \u2013 trade, investments, supply chains, cyber, critical technologies, freedom of navigation, and national security.\nb.Multilateralism and economic imperatives are being overshadowed by national concerns, with countries increasingly pursuing self-reliance and resilience such as by \u201con-shoring\u201d or \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d their supply chains.\nThe result is a growing bifurcation in the technological and economic systems.\nMichael Spence, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, recently wrote an article on this destructive decoupling, and warned that it was a \u201cdistinctly suboptimal and perilous course\u201d. He was chairman of the World Bank\u2019s Growth Commission.\na.I was a member of the Growth Commission. I take his views seriously.\nb.Given current trends, destructive decoupling will adversely impact global economic growth, supply chain resilience, as well as food and energy security. All countries will be poorer because of it. Southeast Asia and the Global South will be disproportionately impacted.\nWe must address these challenges head on. We must avert a clash between powerful strategic rivals. We should urge them to wage peace and not war. How?\nFirst, uphold the rules-based international order, as embodied in the UN Charter and international law. Disagreements should be settled in accordance with international law, and in the spirit of goodwill, cooperation, and dialogue. Full weight should be given to the perspectives and interests of all countries, regardless of size.\nSecond, support a free, open, and updated rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\nThird, instead of destructive decoupling, work towards constructive coupling. CPTPP, RCEP, and the China-Singapore large scale projects I mentioned earlier are examples of constructive coupling. Countries should play a positive-sum game, not a zero-sum game. In other words, bring about a better and more prosperous world, through a prosper-thy-neighbours attitude, not beggar-thy-neighbours approach.\nLet me conclude. Asia has come a long way because of peace and the integration of its economies. Our region must remain open and inclusive. We should encourage all parties, including the US and EU, to deepen ties with Asia. This will promote greater interdependence and give external countries a stake in our region\u2019s peace, stability, and prosperity.\nI hope this conference will give us more ideas and greater impetus to embark on new initiatives for constructive partnership.\nThank you."

        "content": "Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan represented Singapore at the Arctic Encounter Symposium 2023 held in Anchorage, Alaska, USA from 29 to 31 March. This was part of Singapore\u2019s ongoing engagement of the Arctic since becoming an Observer State in the Arctic Council in 2013.\nThe Arctic Encounter Symposium 2023 was attended by over 800 participants including government officials, representatives of the Arctic indigenous peoples, and members of the business and academic communities. Special Envoy Tan spoke at a VIP armchair dialogue on \u201cAn Indo-Pacific Arctic: Emerging Regional Interests from Sub-Arctic Asia\u201d on 29 March 2023, as well as a panel discussion titled \u201cArctic Partners and Neighbors: Growing Partnerships In and Out of the Region\u201d on 31 March 2023.\nIn his remarks, Special Envoy Tan spoke about Singapore\u2019s interests in the Arctic and how Singapore has participated actively in Arctic-related activities over the past decade. As a low-lying coastal state, Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, rising temperatures and the melting of ice sheets in the Arctic. This in turn leads to sea-level rise which poses an existential threat to the physical survival of Singapore and underscores the importance for Singapore to be plugged into developments in the Arctic.\nAt the same time, Singapore has undertaken research related to the Arctic, such as the tracking of Arctic migratory birds that stop in Singapore during the Arctic winter season; shared Singapore\u2019s experience in managing oil spills with the Emergency Preparedness, Prevention and Response (EPPR) Working Group; and regularly engaged the Arctic Council\u2019s Permanent Participants and indigenous communities.\nSpecial Envoy Tan also noted how the Arctic Council is an important platform for research and activities in the Arctic region, and that its Observer States would take their cue from the Member States on whether to resume the Arctic Council activities in the near future. Notwithstanding this, Singapore will continue to support the work, mission and activities of the Arctic Council, including under the various Working Groups, so that the global community can benefit from the activities spearheaded by the Arctic Council.\nOn the sidelines of the Symposium, Special Envoy Tan met with various representatives of Arctic indigenous peoples, US government officials involved in Arctic affairs, as well as Senior Arctic Officials from other Arctic Council Member and Observer States.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n1 APRIL 2023\nPhoto caption: Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan speaking at the panel discussion on \u201cArctic Partners and Neighbors: Growing Partnerships In and Out of the Region\u201d on 31 March 2023\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan speaking at the panel discussion on \u201cArctic Partners and Neighbors: Growing Partnerships In and Out of the Region\u201d on 31 March 2023\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan speaking at the panel discussion on \u201cArctic Partners and Neighbors: Growing Partnerships In and Out of the Region\u201d on 31 March 2023\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

        "content": "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Singapore on 16 March 2023 for the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders\u2019 Retreat. This was Prime Minister Lee\u2019s sixth Leaders\u2019 Retreat with President Joko Widodo, and the first to be hosted in Singapore since the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Leaders reaffirmed the excellent state of relations between Singapore and Indonesia. They agreed that the bilateral relationship had strengthened substantially over President Joko Widodo\u2019s two terms as President, providing a solid foundation to develop new areas of cooperation that are deep, multifaceted, forward-looking, and mutually-beneficial for future generations.\nThe Leaders welcomed the ratification of all three agreements under the Expanded Framework, namely: the Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR, the Treaty for the Extradition of Fugitives, and the Defence Cooperation Agreement. The Leaders looked forward to the completion of the next step of obtaining approval from the International Civil Aviation Organization for the new arrangements under the FIR Agreement, so that both countries can bring all three agreements into force on a mutually agreed date. The resolution of these longstanding issues is a testament to the strength and maturity of our bilateral relations.\nPrime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo affirmed that bilateral relations are on strong footing and agreed to deepen cooperation in sustainable and forward-looking areas of mutual interest. To this end, the Leaders\u2019 witnessed the exchange of six Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) in emerging sectors like the digital economy, sustainability, and human capital development, as well as in traditional areas like security.\nThe Leaders noted the development of the digital economy in Singapore and Indonesia through cooperative projects like the Nongsa Digital Park in Batam. The Leaders welcomed the MOU on Tech:X Programme between the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, which allows young tech professionals in both countries to undertake work opportunities in each other\u2019s markets. This will deepen networks between Singapore and Indonesia\u2019s tech ecosystems and allow tech talents to pursue opportunities in the fast-growing digital economy.\nFocusing on common interests in sustainability, Prime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo welcomed the signing of the MOU on Renewable Energy Cooperation between the Singapore Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment. The MOU will put in place a framework for commercial cooperation on the development of renewable energy capabilities, transmission infrastructure and cross-border electricity trading. The Leaders also witnessed the signing of an MOU on Sustainable Urban and Housing Development between the Singapore Ministry of National Development and the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning, to facilitate knowledge-sharing and training in sustainable infrastructure development.\nPrime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo recognised that people remained the most important resource of both countries and witnessed the signing of MOUs to invest in human capital through knowledge-sharing, capacity-building and training across various sectors. This includes the MOU on Health Cooperation between the Singapore Ministry of Health and the Indonesian Ministry of Health, and an MOU regarding Collaboration on Knowledge Sharing, Capacity Building and Research between the Singapore Centre for Liveable Cities, Ministry of National Development, and the Indonesian Nusantara National Capital Authority. The Leaders also welcomed the announcements on new projects under the Human Capital Partnership Agreement between the Singapore Ministry of Education and the Indonesian Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, and the renewal of people-to-people exchanges in vocational training and between the respective civil services. These areas of collaboration and exchanges will augment existing expertise, strengthen interpersonal ties, and anchor positive relations between the two countries\u2019 peoples.\nThe Leaders recognised the need to continue collaboration in traditional sectors like security and finance amid a more uncertain global environment, whether through the Indonesia-Singapore Joint Update on Defence Cooperation between the two Ministries of Defence, the extension of the Bilateral Financial Agreement (BFA) between the central banks, or the establishment of a cooperation framework for Urban Search and Rescue between the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency. Together, these present opportunities for Singapore and Indonesia to build confidence in security and economic partnerships.\nThe Leaders agreed that bilateral cooperation should continue to be multi-faceted and comprehensive. They welcomed the signing of nine MOUs between Singapore and Indonesian businesses on 15 March 2023 in the digital economy sector, including in health technology and education technology.

I am delighted to join you for the closing ceremony of the 2nd RISING Fellowship. The fellowship was first launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Joko Widodo in 2018 as a platform to build and strengthen relationships between leaders from Indonesia and Singapore and for us to learn from each other. I am glad that after a three-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now able to resume these exchanges and deepen our engagement as we look ahead to the many new and emerging areas of bilateral cooperation. Your presence today is a testament to the excellent ties between our countries, and the strong friendship between our people.\nI understand you had a busy week, interacting with our Cabinet Ministers and officials, attending networking sessions, and making site visits to Republic Polytechnic and the Keppel Marina East Desalination Plant. I hope this year\u2019s programme has offered you fresh new ideas and a better sense of the range of opportunities for collaboration, and also allowed you to make new friends and connections along the way.\nSingapore and Indonesia share a deep and enduring friendship. We communicate openly, and act in good faith and with mutual respect. This element of mutual trust is a precious commodity which has been built up over many years through regular exchange programmes such as the RISING Fellowship. As the next generation of young leaders, I hope that all of you will continue to stay engaged and deepen the bonds and friendships which have been formed over the past week.\nLet me make three brief points on our bilateral relationship. First, in a global environment that is increasingly volatile, complex and dangerous, no country can work alone. All around us, we see anxiety among our citizens over economic uncertainty, rising inflation, the food and energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, and superpower contestation. Yet, it is important to remember that modern challenges like pandemics, supply chain disruptions, food resilience, and climate change are not constrained by borders. Countries must work together to address these challenges. It is therefore critical for Singapore and Indonesia to cooperate even more closely - both bilaterally, and with our fellow ASEAN Member States. Singapore will give our full support for Indonesia\u2019s ASEAN Chairmanship this year, as we did for your G20 Presidency in 2022.\nSecond, we are keen to do more with Indonesia and explore mutually beneficial opportunities to tap into Indonesia\u2019s potential as an economic powerhouse with a young and innovative population. We will continue to deepen our links, not just with Jakarta, but also provincial governments and local leaders to explore collaboration in areas such as the green and digital economies, tourism, education and agribusiness. We hope to build on the success of bilateral projects such as the Nongsa Digital Park in Batam and the Kendal Industrial Park in Central Java, which not only support Indonesia\u2019s growing industrial and digital needs but also creates jobs for Indonesians and local communities.\nThird, we must continue to strengthen our longstanding and multi-faceted people-to-people ties. Thousands of Indonesians study and work in Singapore. Indonesia was also Singapore\u2019s largest source of tourist arrivals last year. In my many visits to Indonesia, I often meet Singaporeans who live in Indonesia and contribute in their own ways to the community. Many of them tell me about their way of life in Indonesia, and their love for Indonesian food and culture. We hope to send more of our students to gain exposure to Indonesia through exchange programmes and work attachments. These people-to-people exchanges help build mutual understanding and trust, which underpin the foundation of our bilateral relationship and will anchor our engagement for many years to come.\nI hope you have had a fruitful visit to Singapore for the RISING Fellowship. There is so much more that we can do together, learn from each other and support one another, as our countries emerge stronger than before from the pandemic. I hope you will continue to stay in touch, visit each other, exchange ideas and work together to take our bilateral relations to even greater heights. Thank you very much."

This is the first time Singapore is participating in an Arctic forum in Japan. I would like to congratulate my Icelandic friends for bringing the Arctic discussions to Asia and my Japanese friends for their warm hospitality at this well-organised event.\n2. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of Singapore joining the Arctic Council as an Observer State and I am delighted to share more about Singapore\u2019s involvement in the Council over the last 10 years.\n3. Naturally, some may wonder why Singapore, a small tropical island-state 10,000 km away from the Arctic, is interested in Arctic issues.\n4. In a nutshell, Singapore believes that climate change is real, and that rising global temperatures will result in the melting of Arctic ice sheets which will in turn have profound global implications - rising sea-levels being one of them. As a low-lying country with 30% of our island not much higher than the sea-level, rising sea levels are a threat to the physical survival of Singapore.\n5. To demonstrate how seriously Singapore views this issue, we have committed US$75 billion over the next few decades to develop a comprehensive system to protect our coastlines. Amongst various initiatives, Singapore is currently building our first polder on one of our offshore islands.\n6. In addition, changes in the Arctic will invariably change the future of maritime shipping. In particular, the Northern Sea Route could reduce travel time between Europe and Northeast Asia by up to two or three weeks.\n7. As the Arctic Sea routes open up, infrastructure will have to be further developed to ensure safe shipping in the region. To this end, Singaporean companies are keen to work with our Arctic partners to jointly seize new opportunities in ship building and port management/building in the Arctic. For example, a Singapore company called Keppel Singmarine was the first Asian shipyard to build icebreakers in 2008 while PSA International is a leading port group with a global network encompassing 160 locations in 42 countries. These are just some of the Singaporean companies which have the capacities and capabilities to contribute to the sustainable development of infrastructure and facilities in the Arctic.\n8. Over the past decade, we have worked closely with the AC under various Working Groups.\n9. For example, our National Parks Board works with the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) to track Arctic migratory birds that stop in Singapore during the Arctic winter season; our Maritime and Port Authority officials have shared our approach to inter-agency coordination and using drones in managing oil spills with the Emergency Preparedness, Prevention and Response (EPPR) Working Group.\n10. Singapore also engages the AC\u2019s Permanent Participants (PPs). Since 2013, we have organised three Study Visits to Singapore for various Permanent Participants, most recently in 2017 and we continue to welcome more such meaningful exchanges with the Permanent Participants in the future.\n11. As a small country, it is in Singapore\u2019s interest to remain closely connected to the world and to understand how changes in climate patterns, environmental and economic developments, even in a distant region like the Arctic, can impact Singapore. We also seek to make friends and work with like-minded countries in co-creating solutions to address some of these challenges.\n12. In the meantime, Singapore is still learning when it comes to Arctic issues, and we remained committed to deepening our understanding of the region. I look forward to hearing from everyone today on how we can better do so. Thank you.\nSpecial Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan deliver a speech during the \u201cContributions of Observer States to the Arctic Council\u201d high-level plenary session on 5 March 2023\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Icelandic Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Member of the Japanese House of Representatives Shindo Yoshitaka\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Member of the Japanese House of Representatives Kikawada Hitoshi\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

She also shared about Singapore\u2019s partnership with fellow developing countries to enhance capacity building under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The transcript of SMS Sim\u2019s speech is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n6 MARCH 2023\nNATIONAL STATEMENT BY\nSENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF SINGAPORE SIM ANN\nAT THE SECOND PART OF THE FIFTH UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES\n6 MARCH 2023\nMr President, Excellencies,\nLet me first convey Singapore\u2019s appreciation to the Government of Qatar and the United Nations for organising this important meeting.\nWhen we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, we made the fundamental commitment to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d. We have now reached the critical mid-point of our journey. There is great urgency to reaffirm this core commitment and step up our efforts to address the needs and priorities of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).\nIn May last year, the UN Secretary-General warned that the \u201cvery viability of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\u201d is at risk. The LDCs are among those facing the greatest difficulties. They have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\nBut there are also opportunities to \u201crescue\u201d the SDGs as highlighted by the Secretary-General. This Conference is one such opportunity. We need to fulfil our commitment to the LDCs through concrete and collective action. Allow me to highlight four areas where we should focus our efforts: Firstsupportingclimate resilience. The LDCs are the least responsible for climate change but are among the hardest hit. To help the LDCs build long-term resilience against the impact of climate change, we need to significantly scale up technical and financial support from the international community. In this regard, we strongly support the target of allocating 50 percent of climate financing to climate adaptation.\nSecondclosing the financing gap. Widening fiscal deficits and increased debt burden are hampering the ability of LDCs to eradicate poverty, respond to external shocks, invest in their people, and build inclusive societies. We must reform the global financial architecture to provide the scale and reliability of financing required to achieve the SDGs.\nThirdacceleratingdigital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital technology worldwide, but it has also laid bare the huge digital divide among and within countries. Only 25 percent of people in the LDCs use the Internet, compared to 80 percent in advanced economies. If we are serious about closing the digital divide, we will need to step up efforts to promote universal connectivity, enhance digital skills and training, and invest in digital infrastructure.\nFourthstrengthening global partnerships. Our experience with COVID-19 has shown that multilateral cooperation is the best way forward. Singapore strongly supports the Doha Programme of Action\u2019s call for a renewed and strengthened global partnership with South-South cooperation as an important pillar. Since 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP has been our platform for technical cooperation with developing countries. It originated as a way for Singapore to share our development experience and pay forward the assistance that we had received during our formative years. We have cooperated with UN agencies to deliver programmes in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. Our Third Country partnerships, including those with Chile, Japan, Qatar, Thailand, T\u00fcrkiye, and the US, have facilitated North-South and South-South Cooperation. To date, we have welcomed close to 150,000 government officials as part of our SCP programmes, with more than 40 percent from the LDCs. This year, we will launch a three-year Sustainability Action Package to support capacity-building for all developing countries, focusing on resilience building strategies, green project management and financing, as well as carbon market development. We will continue to work with our partners to pool resources and expertise to better meet the needs of LDCs.\nExcellencies,\nAs a global community, we must not leave anyone behind in our collective journey towards the SDGs. In line with the theme of this conference, \u201cFrom Potential to Prosperity\u201d, let us work together to support the LDCs to realise their vast potential and achieve a prosperous future.\nThank you."

Singapore and Vietnam are longstanding friends and Strategic Partners, and have worked closely to promote regional growth and stability in ASEAN. Our bilateral cooperation has continued to grow from strength to strength in many areas such as trade, security, education, and finance. Earlier this year, Singapore and Vietnam launched the Green-Digital Economic Partnership. I am confident that we will see strong bilateral cooperation in emerging areas such as renewable energy and carbon credits. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations and 10th anniversary of our Strategic Partnership this year, I look forward to working with you to grow our mutually beneficial partnership.\nPlease accept my best wishes for your good health and success.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Vo Van Thuong\nPresident\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam"

        "content": "On 4 March 2023, the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), presided over by Rena Lee, Singapore\u2019s Ambassador for Oceans and Law of the Sea Issues and Special Envoy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, successfully concluded negotiations on a new international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nThe BBNJ Agreement is the culmination of discussions that began in 2004 under the auspices of the United Nations to enhance the international legal regime concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the oceans beyond the exclusive economic zones and continental shelves of states. Despite being extremely biodiverse, only 1% of the high seas is currently regulated. The BBNJ Agreement is therefore a major step forward in contributing to the governance of the global commons. Singapore has presided over negotiations of the Agreement since September 2018.\nThe BBNJ Agreement covers access to and use of marine genetic resources; the adoption of conservation and sustainable use measures and the conduct of environmental impact assessments in the maritime areas beyond national jurisdiction; and capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.\nAn innovative aspect of the BBNJ Agreement involves a commitment by developed countries to provide an additional 50% of their annual financial contributions under the Agreement to fund capacity-building projects which will help developing countries conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity, as well as to implement the Agreement. The BBNJ Agreement also commits states to share benefits from the use of marine genetic resources including by facilitating access to samples and data from scientific research into marine organisms of the areas beyond national jurisdiction to researchers from both developed and developing countries.\nAn MFA Spokesperson said:\n\u201cSingapore welcomes the successful and timely conclusion of the BBNJ Agreement, which comes just after the 40th anniversary of the adoption of UNCLOS in 1982 under another Singaporean President, Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh. The success of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference process reaffirms the importance and relevance of UNCLOS and multilateral cooperation, and the United Nations in establishing and upholding a rules-based international order. Ambassador Lee\u2019s leadership and guidance enabled parties to bridge differences and arrive at an ambitious and future-proof BBNJ Agreement.\nSingapore looks forward to the universal adoption and effective implementation of the BBNJ Agreement.\u201d\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n5 MARCH 2023\nPhoto caption: The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) congratulating its President, Ambassador Rena Lee, on the successful conclusion of the BBNJ treaty\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) congratulating its President, Ambassador Rena Lee, on the successful conclusion of the BBNJ treaty\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) congratulating its President, Ambassador Rena Lee, on the successful conclusion of the BBNJ treaty\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

We will never have the size, the clout or the power that the people at the head of this room will have. Allow me to make some candid remarks from that perspective.\nFirst, the war in Ukraine needs to stop. All of us need to comply with the UN Charter and to defend the right of all nations, big or small, to have their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity fully respected.\nSecond, we do need the two biggest superpowers in the room to engage intensely and comprehensively with each other. They need to de-escalate the tensions for those of us in Asia, especially in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\nWe need the leadership of both the US and China if we are to deal with any of the global challenges that confront us. We also need to deal with this emerging issue of bifurcation of technology and economies. I understand the national security imperative to have more resilient supply chains. But bifurcation taken too far will inevitably lead to increased inflation, slower technological progress and reduced growth and cooperation.\nAll of us need to support multilateralism; not just in words, but in exercising the self-restraint to accept a rules-based regime which will not necessarily give all of us everything that we want all the time. We do need to reform the UN (United Nations) and the Bretton Woods Institutions and the WTO (World Trade Organization) to reflect current realities, and future and emerging needs.\nI want to appeal especially to the WTO, because Singapore is a tiny city state where trade is three times our GDP. Even if you have disagreements, reform, but do not paralyse the WTO. I am glad that the WTO Director-General just informed me that there is some progress on getting the WTO Appellate Body moving again, I hope, in the near future.\nFinally, we need to fulfil the Paris Agreement. We need to collectively increase our ambition if we want to deal effectively with climate change, which will inevitably also complicate food security for all of us.\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT THE 2023 NEW DELHI\nG20 FOREIGN MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nPLENARY SESSION TWO:\nCOUNTER-TERRORISM,\nGLOBAL SKILL MAPPING AND TALENT POOL AND\nHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/DISASTER RELIEF\nFirst, let me echo the comments from my other colleagues. We express our sympathy to both Turkey and Syria for the devastating earthquakes. Natural disasters will occur from time to time. No country, no matter how well prepared, can cope all alone. This is a clear example where we do need to make common cause, especially when there is urgency to save lives as quickly as possible.\nI also wanted to first make a point on the scourge of illegal drugs. Some of you may be aware that Singapore has one of the strictest laws, the harshest penalties for illegal drugs. Drugs are a national security, public health and law and order challenge. It reinforces our determination to continue on this path in order to keep our societies safe.\nOn terrorism, even a tiny city state, modern and compact as Singapore, has our share of people who are self-radicalised \u2013 typically young men. They do not need to travel to become radicalised; they surf the internet. We need to remain vigilant to the fact that terrorist groups are using the internet to disseminate highly polished propaganda which quite effectively radicalises young people. This is turn, can lead to lone-wolf attacks, communication with overseas cells and recruitment internationally.\nSecond, the real danger from terrorism is not just the innate damage, physical damage, or loss of lives, but the descension that causes within society - the loss of cohesion and social compact. We do need to work closely together to share intelligence and work effectively. This is another example of a transboundary threat which requires a collective approach.\nFinally, let me end on the point of global skills. All global challenges of the future \u2013 digital revolution, terrorism, climate change, pandemic response and the economy \u2013 all of them need a young and educated population that is well trained and au fait with the latest technologies. The other thing that we have also discovered is the need for skills retraining in adults. Most people are going to have a portfolio of jobs \u2013 they are not going to have one job for the rest of their lives. Skills development is a project we are working closely with India in. We have established three skills centres in New Delhi, Rajasthan and Assam since 2012. The challenge now is to scale up.\nThank you, Mr Chair.\nPhoto captionMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting, 2 March 2023\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto captionIndian External Affairs Minister Dr S.

I thank the organisers - Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada and Universities Canada - for putting together what promises to be an expansive showcase of the many unique opportunities this region presents for Canadian companies and institutions.\nThis conference, which emphasises the importance of cross-Pacific links and deepening exchanges, could not have come at a more timely moment. It has become somewhat fashionable to unwind international connections. People are losing faith in globalisation as its benefits were not pitched adequately, and those disadvantaged were not adequately taken care of. Nativist sentiments around the world are growing. The rules-based multilateral system is being severely eroded, as geopolitical rivalry sharpens. However, our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic shows that multilateral cooperation is the only way forward - no one is safe until all of us are safe.\nThe external environment has a profound impact on Singapore, our livelihoods, and our way of life. To put things in perspective, we are a nation state slightly larger than the city of Toronto in total land mass. We had our independence thrust upon us in 1965, and were immediately confronted with the need to make ourselves open and relevant to the world. We began as a trading nation and embraced globalisation from the very beginning. Our trade is now more than three times our GDP.\nAnd so, despite the push back against globalisation, Singapore is doubling down on our international connections. We ensure that our policies are business friendly, our workforce is skilled, and our legal and regulatory systems are transparent and trusted, so that businesses looking to expand in the region can rely on us. We are also working with partners internationally to facilitate growth of the green and digital economies.\nSo, we welcome you and I thank you for choosing Singapore as your gateway to Asia. I encourage you to explore the brimming potential and opportunities, and Southeast Asia in particular has to offer.\na.Southeast Asia remains a bright spot in the post pandemic global economy. We are a dynamic region with enormous potential.\nb.We collectively enjoy a rich demographic dividend, with a population of about 700 million \u2013 half of them are below the age of 35.\nc.In aggregate, ASEAN is the fifth-largest economy in the world. Our combined GDP of US$3.3 trillion is projected to double, if not quadruple, over the next two decades, making ASEAN a key global economic tent pole in a multipolar world.\nd.Last year, ASEAN and Canada committed to establishing a Strategic Partnership, and I am sure that this will bring about even more opportunities for deeper engagement.\nSingapore-Canada relations\nSingapore and Canada are like-minded partners in many ways. We are partners in multilateral platforms such as ASEAN, APEC, and the World Trade Organization, where we work together in the Ottawa Group to strengthen and update the rules-based multilateral trading system. During the pandemic, Singapore and Canada were among a small group of countries that committed to maintaining open and connected supply chains. We are also partners in the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership), where Members have committed to pursue deeper economic integration for the benefit of businesses, workers, and consumers. Singapore is working closely with Canada on its accession to the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, or DEPA. Singapore and Canada also enjoy good cooperation on climate change issues, including through Singapore\u2019s participation in the Ministerial on Climate Action, the US-Canada Greening Government Initiative, and the Powering Past Coal Alliance.\nBilaterally, Canada is the seventh largest source of foreign direct investment in Singapore. Investment stock stood at over S$90 billion in 2021, primarily in the financial and insurance sector, like manufacturing, and the wholesale and retail trade sectors. We have over 1,300 Canadian companies registered in Singapore, a ten-fold increase over the past decade.\nOn the defence and security front, Canada\u2019s Defence Minister is an active participant in the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. In line with our shared desire for an open and inclusive regional security architecture, the ASEAN Defence Ministers will welcome the commencement of Canada\u2019s participation in the ADMM-Plus Experts\u2019 Working Group Observership Programme in 2023.\nEducation links is another part, an important part, of the growing Singapore-Canada relationship. In my other capacity at the Ministry of Education, I have been happy to support the growing collaboration between Singapore\u2019s Autonomous Universities and Canadian tertiary institutions like the University of Calgary, University of British Columbia, and McGill University. These partnerships are producing impactful research and innovative solutions for our modern-day challenges. One example is the joint NTU-UBC Research Centre of Excellence in Active Living for the Elderly, which was set up to develop artificial intelligence technology to enable the elderly to lead active and independent lives. Our students have also benefited immensely from these institutional partnerships. Through the Canada-ASEAN Scholarships and Educational Exchanges for Development, or the SEED programme, tertiary students and mid-career professionals from the ASEAN region, including Singapore, receive scholarships to pursue their studies in Canada in fields aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. More importantly, such collaboration allows our younger generation to connect and work together, appreciate each other\u2019s background and perspectives and find common solutions for challenges that their generation will face.\nIn the face of global challenges, conferences like this forge greater understanding and meaningful interaction between our peoples and businesses. Globalisation has reduced the distance between us. It is up to us to harness the continued potential it offers. I wish you all the very best, as you build your networks and explore new opportunities in Singapore and our region.\nThank you. Have a great conference."

We have also targeted some of these campaigns at vulnerable groups such as migrant workers.\nTech-Enabled Crimes and Solutions\nToday\u2019s meeting is timely, as emerging trends in technologies have enabled perpetrators to devise new ways to carry out their trafficking activities. These criminals run transnational operations and it has become easier for them to exchange information, coordinate operations and to even recruit victims online.\nAt the same time, technology has also helped law enforcement agencies in the deterrence and prevention of crimes. I would like to share Singapore\u2019s experience in harnessing tech-enabled solutions to improve our capabilities for the detection of such crimes, and the apprehension and conviction of the criminals.\nFor example, to better detect undocumented immigrants concealed in the hidden compartments of vehicles, our border enforcement agency complements profiling techniques with non-intrusive radiographic scanning systems and fibre scopes.\nTo augment our ability to detect fraudulent travel documents, we have also operationalised a multi-modal biometrics clearance concept. For example, instead of using travellers\u2019 fingerprints for identity verification and immigration clearance, their irises and facial images are scanned.\nOther tech-enabled solutions include leveraging forensic software platforms to process, sort and analyse large volumes of images and videos which may contain content on child sexual abuse. New analytics and data management systems also enhance our officers\u2019 capabilities to analyse large volumes of suspicious transaction reports.\nOur experience has shown that technology can not only help with the prevention of trafficking in persons, but also augment and streamline investigations.\nSingapore therefore welcomes the focus of today\u2019s conference, and stands ready to continue working closely with our partners on exchanging best practices, so that we can stay ahead of the curve and collectively address these challenges."

Besides travel advisories, Singaporeans should check for other travel-related information on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) website such as the contact details of the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission and the local emergency services. Singaporeans can reach out to the 24/7 MFA Duty Office if they require consular assistance and advice while overseas.\n2 Singaporeans are strongly encouraged to e-register with MFA before going overseas. This will enable MFA to reach out to them to check on their safety and provide consular assistance in the event there is an emergency or natural disaster. Singaporeans should pay attention to unfamiliar weather and driving conditions; make adequate preparations for the activities pursued and purchase comprehensive travel insurance that includes emergency medical care and evacuation.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n6 FEBRUARY 2023"

This is Special Envoy Tan\u2019s 8th participation at the conference.\nThe Arctic Frontiers, a non-profit organisation, was established in 2006 with the aim of linking policy, business, and science for responsible and sustainable development of the Arctic. Founded upon the five pillars of Policy, Business, Science, Arena and Youth, its annual key event, the AFC, is a platform for academia and decision makers from government and business to gather and discuss the most pressing issues facing the Arctic.\nSpecial Envoy Tan participated in the high-level panel discussion titled \u201cFood on the Move\u201d on 1 February 2023, where he spoke about Singapore\u2019s strategies in food security. Special Envoy Tan highlighted that, as a small country with limited land and sea areas and no natural resources, Singapore currently imports more than 90% of its food from overseas. One of the core strategies to ensure food security is the diversification of Singapore\u2019s import sources where food products are sourced from more than 170 countries and regions. In addition, Singapore's government has launched a \u201c30 by 30\u201d Goal to produce food locally to meet 30% of the domestic nutritional needs by 2030. To achieve this objective, Special Envoy Tan also shared how Singaporean companies work closely with relevant government agencies such as Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to leverage on technology such as AI and IoT to boost Singapore\u2019s domestic agriculture and aquaculture outputs. Special Envoy Tan also took the opportunity to highlight Singapore\u2019s efforts in developing alternative protein products which include, amongst others, being the first country to approve the sale of cultured meats in 2020 and the commercial sale of alternative proteins in 2022.\nSpecial Envoy Tan also met President of the Norwegian Saami Parliament Silje Karine Muotka; US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Douglas Jones; US Executive Director of the White House Arctic Executive Steering Committee David Balton; Norwegian Senior Arctic Official Morten H\u00f8glund; Icelandic Senior Arctic Official P\u00e9tur \u00c1sgeirsson; Canadian Senior Arctic Official Heidi Kutz; ROK Ambassador for Polar Affairs Hong Young Ki; Japanese Ambassador in Charge of Arctic Affairs Takewaka Keizo; and Rector of the University of Troms\u00f8 Dag Rune Olsen.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 FEBRUARY 2023\nPhoto CaptionSpecial Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan participating in a high-level panel discussion titled \u201cFood on the Move\u201d at the 16th Arctic Frontiers Conference in Troms\u00f8, Norway\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto CaptionSpecial Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan\u2019s meeting with President of the Norwegian Saami Parliament Silje Karine Muotka\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto CaptionSpecial Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan\u2019s meeting with Rector of the University of Troms\u00f8 Dag Rune Olsen\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

        "date": "16 Dec 2022, 15:41",
        "country": "Indonesia",
        "content": "The Global Governance Group (3G) [1] welcomes the successful and substantive outcome of the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit held in Bali, Indonesia, from 15 to 16 November 2022. The 3G notes that the G20 Summit took place at a time of unparalleled multidimensional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and that the G20 has witnessed that the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy. The 3G appreciates the G20\u2019s commitment to uphold international law and the multilateral system, which includes defending all principles enshrined in the United Nations (UN) Charter.\nIn the context of the prevailing food crisis, the 3G welcomes the commitment of the G20 to take urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture, food systems and supply chains. The 3G thus appreciates the G20\u2019s support for open, transparent, inclusive, predictable and non-discriminatory, rules-based agricultural trade based on World Trade Organisation rules.\nThe 3G notes the G20\u2019s assessment that we are experiencing volatility in energy prices and markets, as well as shortages and disruptions to energy supply, which have been compounded by geopolitical challenges. In this context, the 3G appreciates the G20\u2019s commitment to transform and diversify energy systems, and advance energy security and resilience by accelerating clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions.\nThe 3G looks forward to the G20 playing its part in fully implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact and the relevant outcomes of previous Conference of the Parties (COPs) and COPs serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMAs), in particular COP-26 and more recently COP-27, including the call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in our Nationally Determined Contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement. The 3G reiterates that climate change is an existential global issue and calls for all countries to work with the G20 to address this challenge together.\nThe 3G further notes the G20\u2019s assessment that international health threats are ever present and agrees that the G20 and broader global community must come together to improve our collective prevention, preparedness and response capabilities (PPR). The 3G thus welcomes the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic PPR (The \u2018Pandemic Fund\u2019) hosted by the World Bank, which demonstrates the G20\u2019s commitment to increase the capacity of developing countries for pandemic PPR. We appreciate that the G20 is taking steps to ensure that the Pandemic Fund is inclusive of the perspectives of low- and middle- income countries, and non-G20 partners such as the 3G in its decision making.\nThe 3G agrees that digital transformation is a key component in realising the Sustainable Development Goals, and supports international collaboration to facilitate trusted cross-border data flows, as well as further develop digital skills and literacy to harness the positive impacts of digital transformation and enable the sustainable and inclusive growth of the digital economy. While accelerating digitalisation, we have to recognise and address the accompanying challenges such as cyber threats and digital divides to ensure that no one is left behind.\nThe 3G appreciates Indonesia\u2019s active engagement of 3G members during its 2022 G20 Presidency and looks forward to working constructively with the Indian G20 Presidency to realise its priorities of promoting just and equitable growth for all in a sustainable, holistic, responsible, and inclusive manner under the theme \u201cOne Earth, One Family, One Future\u201d. The 3G reiterates that the UN is the only global body with universal participation and clear legitimacy and calls on the G20 to implement actions that complement and strengthen the UN system.\n16 DECEMBER 2022\n[1] The Global Governance Group (3G) comprises the following Member States of the United Nations: Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, San Marino, Senegal, Singapore, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam."

The close and enduring partnership between Singapore and China today bears testament to the key role he had played and the efforts of successive generations of leaders to strengthen bilateral ties.\nPresident Jiang will be remembered for his service and dedication to his country. Our thoughts are with the people of China during this period of bereavement.\nYours sincerely,\nHALIMAH YACOB\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\n30 November 2022\nDear Premier Li,\nOn behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend my deepest condolences on the passing of former President Jiang Zemin.\nPresident Jiang led China during a crucial phase of its development. His steady leadership, and resolute implementation of reform and opening up, were crucial in guiding China\u2019s integration into the global economy and its emergence on the world stage.\nIn 2001, under President Jiang, China joined the World Trade Organisation. This strategic move helped China to push through difficult domestic reforms and fostered its dramatic growth and modernisation, to the immense benefit of both China and its economic partners, including Singapore.\nPresident Jiang met Singapore\u2019s former Prime Ministers Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong on many occasions, and extended them warm hospitality during their visits to China. When he made a State Visit to Singapore in 1994, I had the privilege of being his Minister-in-Attendance.\nPresident Jiang contributed greatly to expanding our bilateral relations, particularly our first Government-to-Government project, the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP). His personal support for the project at the highest level enabled the SIP to overcome initial challenges to become a successful and enduring symbol of the friendship and cooperation between our two countries.\nSingapore\u2019s relations with China have continued to prosper under President Jiang\u2019s successors. His was a lasting contribution which we have consolidated and built upon. President Jiang will long be warmly remembered as an honoured friend of Singapore.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nHis Excellency Li Keqiang\nPremier of the State Council\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China"

It contributes to the important conversation on the global fight against corruption, which continues to be a key challenge facing some countries.\nSingapore\u2019s Approach Towards Fighting Corruption\nSince independence, Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach against corruption and a firm commitment to upholding the rule of law. The Government, Public Service and our People are constantly vigilant and determined to keep corruption at bay. We do not claim to have the best anti-corruption system, although we find that the following four-pronged approach has worked for us over the years:\nWe place not just competence but also integrity at the heart of good governance. Over the years, through conduct beyond reproach and a strong devotion towards public duty, we built up strong trust in our system where decisions taken and policies developed were for the public good rather than private or vested interests.\nThis approach has served us well, and Singapore has had some success in combating corruption. In Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index, Singapore was ranked top in Asia and 4th globally on the list of least corrupt nations in the world. We are however mindful that there is no room for complacency, as the corruption threat is always evolving.\nInternational Cooperation on Anti-Corruption\nSingapore is fully committed to its obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, UNCAC for short, widely recognised as the pre-eminent international instrument against corruption. We will render the necessary assistance, within the ambit of our laws and international obligations, to any country which makes an official request to Singapore with the necessary supporting information.\nWe are also firm believers that internationally agreed norms and principles must be observed. For instance, the implementation review mechanism of the UNCAC, as agreed by UNCAC States Parties, is essentially an intergovernmental process. States Parties work within such agreed parameters towards better implementation of the Convention and share best practices.\nIn an increasingly complex world, we cannot rest on our laurels, and must continue to stay ahead of the game to detect and deter even more sophisticated forms of corruption. Part of the complexity is that corruption has become increasingly borderless. As an international financial hub, Singapore believes that international cooperation and partnerships are essential to tackling corruption, and is committed to strengthening such linkages. For instance, Singapore is a founding member of the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre based in London, which since its inception in 2017 has played a part towards tackling grand corruption. Working closely with our counterparts from several other countries, our national anti-corruption agency has supported the Centre\u2019s operations through intelligence gathering and sharing relating to requests received by the Centre.\nHolistic Approach to Combat Corruption\nSingapore recognises that law enforcement is just one aspect in the fight against corruption. Training and capacity-building programmes to enhance the proficiency of relevant anti-corruption authorities around the world are also important.\nSingapore is pleased to be able to contribute towards the provision of such anti-corruption training and capacity-building. This is another key thrust of our international engagement in this domain. In recent years, Singapore\u2019s anti-corruption agency, the CPIB for short, has worked with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to conduct a training course on \u201cCombating Corruption: Financial Investigations Techniques and International Cooperation Mechanisms\u201d which saw participants from over 16 countries. CPIB also organises an Anti-Corruption Executive Programme which brings together management-level anti-corruption practitioners from around the world. The last run was in 2019, and attended by some 34 participants from 28 countries.\nLet me just end off by saying that involving relevant stakeholders to create anti-corruption solutions is also vital. Domestically, CPIB set up the Anti-Corruption Partnership Network in September 2018, involving private sector companies with the objective of promoting ownership on corruption prevention within the private sector and facilitating the sharing of best practices and experiences by private companies on the pitfalls of corruption and mitigating measures.\nLet\u2019s not forget that the youths are our future. Corruption prevention and education must also take into account effective engagement of this key target group and instil the right values of honesty and integrity.\nConclusion\nI want to conclude by sharing a book - \u2018One Man\u2019s View of The World\u2019. Singapore\u2019s Founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew observed that, and I quote: \u201cIn the end, my greatest satisfaction in life comes from the fact that I have spent years gathering support, mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races \u2013 and that it will endure beyond me, as it has\u201d. This did not happen by chance. It is hard-earned, and takes even greater effort and will to sustain. And these efforts will continue in Singapore.

Singapore welcomed both CSPs, especially the contributions by both India and the US towards an open, inclusive, peaceful, stable and prosperous region.\n2 Singapore and ASEAN will benefit economically from the CSPs. With India, ASEAN will commence reviewing the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) to make it more user-friendly, simple, and trade-facilitative to facilitate stronger trade and investment flows.

ASEAN and the US will further cooperation in the ASEAN Smart Cities Network and strengthen ASEAN\u2019s public health infrastructure through the ASEAN-US Health Futures Initiative.\n3 Through these CSPs, Singapore can deepen collaboration with India in important areas such as regional connectivity, cybersecurity, and the digital economy to benefit our businesses and people. For the US, we hope to work together to support ASEAN\u2019s clean energy transition, strengthen the region\u2019s energy security and grid resilience, and establish low-carbon energy solutions and green energy infrastructure.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n28 NOVEMBER 2022"

Congratulations also to Pakatan Harapan for its strong performance at the General Election.\nYour premiership comes amidst significant challenges in our regional and global environment. As close neighbours and friends, Singapore and Malaysia should work together to manage these challenges and explore new opportunities for cooperation.\nSingapore and Malaysia share a longstanding substantive relationship, underpinned by our historical ties, multi-faceted cooperation, and strong people-to-people links. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our two countries have been steadfast partners supporting each other. The close coordination between our ministers and officials allowed us to maintain the flow of essential goods and workers, and to re-open our borders swiftly and effectively. We have also been close partners in ASEAN, which remains central to stability in Southeast Asia amidst rising geopolitical tensions.\nOur bilateral cooperation has also expanded to new and emerging areas. The two recent bilateral framework agreements on the green and digital economies will create new opportunities for our businesses and peoples. While our trade and investment ties are robust, we can still do much more together to enhance openness, stability, and connectivity in our bilateral relationship for mutual benefit.\nI look forward to meeting you soon, to discuss the common issues facing our two countries and how we can further advance our bilateral relationship.\nHo Ching and I wish you and Dato\u2019 Seri Dr Wan Azizah good health and happiness.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nYAB Dato\u2019 Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim\nPrime Minister\nMalaysia"

        "country": "Bangladesh",
        "content": "Excellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nAllow me to first congratulate Bangladesh for its Chairmanship of IORA over the past year, particularly in light of the challenging environment that we have all had to navigate. Bangladesh has done an impressive job in sustaining the momentum of IORA\u2019s important work. It has overseen the strengthening of IORA's institutional arrangements, including through the implementation of the IORA Action Plan. Under Bangladesh\u2019s able leadership, IORA has continued to grow from strength to strength.\nClimate Change\nIt is timely that we are meeting in IORA immediately following the conclusion of the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP 27, last week. It is important that we will be discussing issues related to the environment, sustainable growth and balanced development in the region. These issues remain at the forefront of our minds, especially given the existential threat posed by climate change. As a responsible global citizen, Singapore recognises that we have a role to play in contributing to a collective response to save the environment. Singapore announced last month that we will raise our national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Even though Singapore accounts for only 0.1% of global emissions, we want to do our part in the global effort to address climate change. Some strategies that we are adopting include raising carbon taxes and developing hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nThe Blue Economy is one of IORA\u2019s priority areas and is part of its action plan from 2022 to 2027. IORA is exploring how best to combat marine debris which is a rising global concern. Combating marine debris is an issue which Singapore takes seriously. We had launched the National Action Strategy on Marine Litter in June this year. This initiative outlines Singapore\u2019s various actions and measures to combat marine litter, which includes items such as plastic bags, glass, wood, and tyres. It is a transboundary issue as litter is moved across oceans by prevailing winds and tides.\nSingapore\u2019s approach to marine litter is comprehensive. We seek to tackle marine litter at its source by adopting a circular economy approach. By tapping on partnerships and engagement with stakeholders, we aim to better understand how we can exploit technology to deal with marine plastic debris more effectively. It is important that countries put in place effective waste management policies, regulations, and enforcement measures, to support the global effort to address transboundary marine litter.\nCapacity building for IORA\nIn addition, Singapore is committed to supporting regional and international efforts to further the global sustainability agenda. Singapore recently organised an in-person capacity building course on \u201cSustainable Tourism\u201d under the Singapore Cooperation Programme for tourism officials from IORA Member States. We shared Singapore\u2019s Green Plan 2030 and facilitated knowledge sharing on sustainable tourism initiatives. We hope such capacity building courses will support the work of the IORA Core Group for Tourism and promote sustainable regional economic growth. Singapore also remains committed to strengthening the IORA Secretariat\u2019s capabilities to better support Member States activities. We had previously organised programmes such as public finance and project management for the IORA Secretariat and Member States. Singapore looks forward to working with both the Secretariat and Member States to continue organising relevant courses in the future.\nConclusion\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nI would like to conclude by thanking Bangladesh once again for hosting the 22nd IORA Council of Ministers meeting.\nWe are confident that discussions will be fruitful and will lead to further strengthening of IORA\u2019s work."

Minister Maliki highlighted the importance of taking a science and data-based approach to policymaking, embracing digital transformation, and enhancing global coordination in health policies by continuing to support the World Health Organisation (WHO). Singapore stands ready to work with the WHO and APEC to strengthen our collective resilience against future global health risks. The full text of Minister Maliki\u2019s remarks is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n18 NOVEMBER 2022\nMINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE, SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT SESSION II, \u2018RECONNECTING THE REGION\u2019 AT THE 2022 APEC MINISTERIAL MEETING IN BANGKOK, THAILAND\nKhun Don and Khun Jurin,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how vulnerable we are to external forces and the effects of globalization. According to a study by the APEC Policy Support Unit, the economic costs of the loss in cross-border mobility during COVID-19 amounted to USD 1.2 trillion in 2020. We must learn from the hard-earned lessons gained from the pandemic and ensure that systems are in place to address future pandemics and ensure that travel remains resilient. Let me share three such lessons.\nFirst, it is important to take a science- and data-based approach to policymaking. While protecting lives is the primary priority, this must be balanced against the need to protect livelihoods. Economies must not rush into implementing protectionist policies when faced with crises. For example, when we impose restrictive travel restrictions, we must take into account the negative impact this has on both the domestic, regional and global economy. Throughout the pandemic, Singapore and a few economies were committed to keeping our air and seaports open to ensure minimal disruptions to global supply chains.\nSecond, we must embrace digital transformation. During the pandemic, those that had access to the internet were able to mitigate the effects of lockdowns, while those that did not were more adversely affected. We must therefore bridge the digital divide, to ensure we move forward together. At the same time, we must capitalise on digital technology to promote greater regional inter-connectivity. One good example is the issuance of digital vaccination certificates. We should standardise the format and ensure interoperability so that cross-border mobility can maintain its resilience when future pandemics strike.\nLastly, we must enhance coordination in our health policies by continuing to support the World Health Organisation, or WHO. The WHO has done good work during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing up to date information, clear scientific guidance and communication. We should continue to support its role in the evolving global health architecture. Singapore will maintain our partnership with the WHO to improve health emergency preparedness, as it is not a matter of if but when the next pandemic will hit us again.\nWe also stand ready to work with APEC to strengthen resilience against future risks."

Because on all matters to do with accession, the decision is made by a consensus of all the existing members of the partnership and particularly, the formal decision to start the accession process depends on consensus amongst the partners.\nSo therefore what China has to do is to engage the partners individually and talk to them and work out any issues they may have with the partners individually, which I think even if you read the newspapers you will know that they have some issues with some of the CPTPP countries and if that process is completed, then, if there is a consensus it can go ahead.\nSingapore this year, we happen to be the chair of the committee. So as chair we will carry out our role objectively and impartially and do our duty as chair. And that is how it has to work, and that is our public position. I have stated it several times. And when I met the prime Premier Li Keqiang I explained it to him again."

        "content": "I really need to thank Danny (Quah) as well as Adam (Posen) for that excessively generous introduction. Let me welcome all of you to Singapore, especially for those of you whom this is your first time, and especially Americans. Think of Manhattan being ejected by upstate New York, and then having to issue your own currency; having your own Army, Navy, Air Force, airport, port, power generation facilities; and (having) to establish a network of Free Trade Agreements across the globe. What you see in Singapore is a tiny city-state that only exists as a conscious act of desperate imagination. I hope you will not just spend your time confined in a hall like this, but go out there and kick the tires and see whether this place works. The next point I want to make is that it is very daunting for an ophthalmologist. I can claim some knowledge of science, medicine, and surgery, but to face an audience of bankers, economists, and investors, and to touch on a topic like this is daunting. But nevertheless, I will give it a go.\nI am also very conscious that in this day and age, attention spans are very limited. So, if you forget everything I have said, just remember three words. The first word \u2013 trust. The second word is fracture. The third is Newton\u2019s third law of motion. Just bear that in mind. Everything else I am providing is just some beef on that framework.\nFirst, I believe the theme for this conference is entirely apt. The global order as we know it is severely stressed. Just think about the COVID-19 pandemic, which we are actually only just emerging from, and it is not yet over. The war in Ukraine rages on. We witness big power not just contestation, but confrontation. Persistent supply chain disruptions \u2013 still not fully resolved. Hyper divisive domestic politics \u2013 you just need to pick up your handphone to see that. We are witnessing probably an era of higher and prolonged inflation which nobody below the age of 40 has lived through in his lifetime. Of course, we also have, hanging over this, the potential for a concurrent food, energy and water crisis. We should also remember climate change and the conference which is going on right now in Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt.\nParticularly for us, the febrile relationship \u2013 and I say this knowing the Ambassador of China is here with us \u2013 but let me put this as delicately as possible. The febrile relationship between the United States and China is of great concern to us \u2013 I think not just to Singapore, but indeed to all countries in the world. I would characterise the relationship as one in which currently there is an almost complete lack of strategic trust. If you think about that, it means you have to assume the worst of each other. In assuming the worst of each other, this inevitably raises the risk of miscalculations and of an escalatory spiral at best, or at worst, an outright collision and conflict.\nI think it is useful for us to take a step back and ask ourselves how we got here. So, bear with me. The United States was the ultimate winner of the Second World War, as well as the First World War for that matter, and really was the ultimate heir and achieved the zenith of the last Industrial Revolution. Especially after the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union imploded, the United States was the undisputed unipolar hyperpower. But the United States was somewhat unique at its moment of victory, both after the war and even at the unipolar moment. If you think about the Marshall Plan and what the United States did to rebuild its enemies during the Second World War \u2013 to rebuild Germany in Europe, and also to provide the platform for Japan to rebuild. In addition to that generosity, to also envision and underwrite, in cash and blood, a multilateral world order, including the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions of the WTO (World Trade Organisation), World Bank, and the IMF (International Monetary Fund), it basically set up a world which was not based on \u2018winner takes all\u2019. It was one that was based on liberal economic principles, free trade, (and) global supply chains. It established a global network of bilateral and multilateral alliances. On the part of the United States, that enabled it, at a time when it was about 40% of global GDP (gross domestic product), to benefit, because for every extra dollar that the world generated, 40 cents accumulated to the United States. The United States enjoyed a period of unprecedented economic growth, including growth of the middle class. You could argue that the introduction of the G.I. Bill (the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944) after the war and educating a whole swathe of people who populate the middle class were domestic successes. But on the international stage, it led an international system and promoted peace, stability, and values generally aligned with American interests. So, America had both hard and soft power. To be fair, the rest of the word, especially small city-states like us in Southeast Asia, benefited from those five decades. In the case of Singapore, our per capita GDP grew from about US$500 57 years ago \u2013it went up more than a hundredfold. It is also worth remembering and often forgotten nowadays that the United States cumulatively has invested more in Southeast Asia than it has cumulatively invested in India, China, and Japan combined. Most people are not aware of this fact. Of course, a large proportion of that investment in Southeast Asia is actually here in Singapore.\nBut Singapore and the other Asian countries were not actually the biggest beneficiaries of Pax Americana. Because, in fact, there was a certain large continental-sized country and economy, which 40 years ago embarked on reform and opening. But before we get to reform and opening, let us go back another thousand years. A thousand years ago, that country \u2013 and obviously, I am referring to China \u2013 probably constituted at least 30% of global GDP. A thousand years ago, they had achieved four great inventions: the compass, gunpowder, paper-making, and printing. This was at a time when Europe was still in the Dark Ages, and modern America was not yet founded. China did make an intellectual and strategic mistake because it then assumed it had reached the zenith of civilisation, closed its borders, passed a law that no Chinese ship would have more than two masts, (and) in fact, it burnt its imperial fleet. Consequently, it missed out on the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution began in Europe, the UK (United Kingdom), and as I said, later on across the Atlantic, the ultimate heir: the United States of America. In Asia, because we were cut off from the science and technology of the Industrial Revolution, we were colonised. Within Asia itself, the first country to embark on modernisation was Japan. We saw that during the Meiji Restoration. It is no accident therefore that (when) the hostilities broke out between Japan and China, Japan prevailed because of its industrial and economic, and therefore military, might. So, we need to remember that China, because it missed the Industrial Revolution, had to endure more than a century of humiliation. But China never forgets its sense of history or its place in the world, and quite naturally and legitimately wants to reclaim its place in the world.\nIn the recent 20th Party Congress (of the Communist Party of China), (PRC) President Xi Jinping referred to science and technology as foundational and strategic pillars, and he emphasised the need for China to build self-reliance and strength in these two areas. This notion of self-reliance and the pursuit of domestic strength is not a new phenomenon, given China\u2019s earlier historic achievements in science and technology. Over the past decade, quite naturally and to be expected, China has strengthened its domestic capabilities in key high-tech sectors, including advanced robotics and AI (artificial intelligence). It has also expanded its advanced manufacturing base. It is no longer just the manufacturer of the world, but it is an advanced manufacturing centre in the world. We sometimes forget that China is not alone in its focus on manufacturing and the concept of \u201cMade In\u201d. There was \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d, but it is worth remembering, for instance, in India, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi had this concept of \u201cMade in India\u201d, and he launched this in 2014. Sometimes when my American friends complain about this apparent attempt at autarky and self-reliance, we forget that it is not confined to China. In fact, today, we also have \u201cMade in America\u201d. That is not new either. If you go back to the 80s, there was \u201cMade in Japan\u201d.\nNow, let me come to China\u2019s reform and opening up 40 years ago, and more recently, 20 years ago, its accession to the WTO \u2013 this turbo-charged its spectacular growth. Here is where a strategic misperception occurred on the part of the West. It was correct for the West and the United States to support China\u2019s accession to the WTO. But the West was wrong when it wishfully believed or hoped that economic openness would invariably lead to Western-style political reforms. Another way of expressing it is that you expected societies elsewhere to be recreated and reformed in your image simply because of economic liberalisation and access. But China believed that perestroika did not necessarily have to come with glasnost. I have made this particular reference to perestroika and glasnost for this very specific reason, because the country that has done the most extensive studies into how and why Soviet Communism collapsed, the country that has studied this most intensively, is China. In particular, the Communist Party of China, which has no intention of repeating the trajectory of Soviet Communism. Hence, we often hear references to \u201cSocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. I say all this so that we try to relieve our obsession with ideological labels, and to understand how and why countries and leaders adopt certain postures. Now, we live in a world where there is a prospect or a potential for China to actually surpass the US (United States), at least in nominal GDP terms. After all, it has a much larger population. But it means the United States, for the first time ever, is facing a peer competitor that is able and willing to compete in all dimensions. The challenge posed by China far exceeds that which America faced with its own immediate neighbours, and even compared to Europe. So, in a sense, you are in uncharted waters. The US \u2013 or at least some of my friends in the US \u2013 have perceived China\u2019s growing economic strength and what is referred to as Civil-Military Fusion as a threat because it potentially enables China to reshape the international order to its advantage. The result of all this is that breakdown, that erosion of strategic trust between both parties.\nRecently, another good friend, (US) National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, delivered a speech. I think it was in September in Washington (D.C.). He spoke of revisiting the longstanding premise of maintaining relative advantage over competitors in certain key technologies, and said that would not be enough, and instead America has to shift to maintain \u201cas large of a lead as possible\u201d in foundational technologies such as advanced logic and memory chips, to power US strength around the world. The US is concerned that advancements in critical and emerging technologies can transform and empower foreign militaries, and ultimately impinge on US national security. Indeed, the more recent announcements on controls on US exports of high-end AI chips and associated semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Actually, this is all but a declaration of a technology war. Such export controls are not new - they just are an expansion of policies. For instance, the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which was introduced under the previous Administration of (US) President (Donald) Trump, and which had barred companies from supplying Huawei with US technology. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are reports of plans by the US to implement similar export controls, beyond chips and semiconductors, to other foundational technologies such as AI software and quantum computing. There may even be further measures, such as a screening mechanism to restrict outbound US investments into sensitive technologies in China.\nOn the other hand, China. I speak now from experience, because even despite COVID-19, I have been there three or four times, and speak regularly to my counterpart (PRC State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi) there. He will regularly remind me that from the Chinese perspective, it is legitimately seeking to make progress and deliver the fruits of technological and economic development for 1.4 billion people. Like the United States, China also considers technological self-sufficiency to be a matter of existential importance. Even as President Xi and other senior Chinese leaders denounce protectionism, decoupling, and unilateral sanctions, they continue to reiterate the importance of building China\u2019s own global network of partnerships, and making China\u2019s industrial and supply chains more resilient and secure.\nI am describing these positions not to support or to take either side, but just describing them in stark terms. The point I am trying to make is if you see therefore how inevitable the absence of strategic trust, you actually have the dynamic that leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy that fractures science, technology, and the economy. It is self-fulfilling. The question, then, is what its consequences for the rest of us are, because we do not make decisions in Washington (D.C) or Beijing, but their decisions affect us.\nThe current situation is somewhat reminiscent of a Thucydides Trap. The absence of strategic trust will lead both sides to always assume the worst. (The) conditions are set - they are a self-fulfilling and mutually escalatory dynamic. This will almost certainly lead to a mutually escalatory, vicious downward spiral. Both sides may unfortunately conclude that science, technology, and supply chain interdependence are risks, or maybe even liabilities. Each side seeks to reduce its mutual interdependence to improve their own supply chain resilience. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic accentuated this search for resilience. As I said just now, this bifurcation will have profound implications for the rest of us.\nFirst, bifurcation will hinder diversification strategies, it will increase concentration risks, it will reduce resilience, it will exacerbate supply chain disruptions, (and) it will be inflationary in its own right.\nSecond, incentives for scientific collaboration and innovation will diminish, as even scientists will suddenly be limited by passports and their ability to collaborate. Since the Renaissance in Europe and the Industrial Revolution, the entire globe has worked on a single technology stack: basic science, applied science, technology, goods, and products. Because we have all worked on that single stack, progress has been accelerated in the last century or two. It has been deflationary, and that is why when you look at the IT (Information Technology) industry, or if you look at chips for instance, costs have come down and more power has accelerated. A fracture of this common technology stack will be inflationary.\nBut that is not all. The technological decoupling will also further disrupt global systems, which in fact have been the enabler of peace, stability, and prosperity for the last 75 years after the end of the Second World War. We worry about a world that is more fractured, more divided, less prosperous, with built-in higher inflation, and frankly, less peaceful. We wait with bated breath in case there are miscalculations, accidents, collisions, (or) unintended consequences.\nThe question then is, what options are available for the rest of us? All of us are dependent on and want to engage the technological and economic stacks of both superpowers. The degree of overlap between both stacks \u2013 both in software and hardware \u2013 will depend to a large extent in the future on how much the United States and China are willing to engage and interoperate with each other. If they reach a modus vivendi, that would be ideal for a place like Singapore. Just follow the money \u2013 American investments here, our trade with China, our trade in services with America, (and) our investments in China. If they reach a modus vivendi and we harvest the fruits of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, synthetic biology, energy transformation, and green development, it is a huge harvest waiting for us. But if they do not, or (if they) force us to choose one side or the other, we would be in a real tough spot.\nOne possible way for the rest of us is to try to conceive a world in which we can have a more open, inclusive, multilateral network of science, technology, and supply chains. You may recall during the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) came about, basically to counterbalance the rapid bipolarisation of the globe at that point in time. Perhaps today, we are finding ourselves in a similar moment in history and a similar dynamic of geostrategic forces as we stare down the abyss into bifurcation, with profoundly damaging consequences for all of us.\nBut what does a non-aligned movement for science, technology, and supply chains look like? I think these are still very early days, but the attributes are: it has to be multipolar, open, and rules-based. There has to be a commitment to open science, the fair sharing and harvesting of intellectual property, and a system in which we will compete to be most innovative, reliable, and trustworthy, rather than be judged simply by which side or the other we have taken. I think these are early days, but I am just putting this on the table to say that the rest of us do have agency, and we will, to the maximum extent, refuse to choose sides.\nParticularly in Asia, when we look now at what is happening in Europe, there was a line. It used to be the iron curtain. Even today's fight in Ukraine is, in a sense, about where the line is. In Asia, we are not interested in bifurcation lines across Asia. Our paradigm that we are offering is overlapping circles of friends. Every country \u2013 and there is great diversity in Asia \u2013 if you were to line all of us up in terms of proximity of economic and political comfort levels with America and China, we would all be on slightly different points of that spectrum. But I do not believe any self-respecting Asian country wants to be trapped, or to be a vassal, or worse to be a theatre for proxy battles. So, I am trying to make the argument for what the rest of the world wants. Whether we will actually achieve this? Only time will tell. Because as I said, the ideal scenario still remains that America and China work out their modus vivendi\nSo, let me conclude. We stand at an inflection point in history. The loss of trust domestically leads to polarised, divided domestic politics. The loss of trust between the two superpowers leads to a dangerous, escalatory vicious cycle. The fracture of a common stack of science, technology, and supply chains is inflationary, disruptive, and dangerous.\nFinally, I will end with Newton's third law of motion \u2013 every action has an equal and opposite reaction. I hope that our superpower friends bear this in mind, and also bear in mind that the rest of us do have agency and do have choices, and to the maximum extent (we) will seek to raft ourselves to each other in open, inclusive architectures. In typical Asian fashion, more circles, less lines, more balance. Thank you all very much. I look forward to some tough questions.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the 2nd Next Step Global Conference on 9 November 2022\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the 2nd Next Step Global Conference on 9 November 2022\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Dr Adam Posen during a dialogue at the Next Step Global Conference on 9 November 2022\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

It is important that countries work together to manage these challenges and explore opportunities for cooperation.\nSingapore and the United Kingdom are staunch supporters of a rules-based multilateral order, and the need to uphold international law. The fundamentals of our bilateral relationship are also robust. Our two countries share strong historical and people-to-people ties. Our collaboration spans many sectors, including trade and investment, security and defence, and research and innovation. Singapore reaffirms our commitment to the Financial Partnership which you signed in June 2021, to facilitate closer regulatory cooperation and boost jobs, trade and investment.\nBilateral cooperation has also expanded beyond traditional sectors, to include new areas such as the digital economy and green economy. The United Kingdom-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement, which was signed in February this year and entered into force in June 2022, is a milestone for both countries and unlocks new growth prospects for our businesses. I am glad that our officials have begun work on a framework for green economy cooperation, which can create new opportunities for our people and businesses.\nI wish you the very best in fostering stability and unity in the United Kingdom, and building a better and more prosperous future for the British people. Amidst your many urgent priorities and full agenda, I hope we can work together to strengthen our longstanding and friendly bilateral relations, and I look forward to working with you to strengthen our Partnership for the Future.\nI wish you good health and success, and look forward to meeting you soon.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nThe Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP\nPrime Minister\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"

Close to 150,000 foreign officials have participated in SCP courses, including 88,000 from ASEAN member states since 1992.\nAt the reception, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan launched the Sustainability Action Package (SAP) to support the capacity-building needs of developing countries on sustainability and climate change.

It is a special occasion. It is all the more special because we are here to commemorate and to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). This is a key milestone for the programme, which is Singapore\u2019s primary platform for technical cooperation with developing countries.\nLet me first try to explain why the SCP has a special place in our hearts. In the past 57 years of Singapore\u2019s independence, we have traversed a long and eventful, and in fact successful, journey which probably exceeded the expectations both of ourselves and perhaps for others who looked upon Singapore back in 1965. One key point is that we have not forgotten the generosity and support of our international partners and friends who played a vital role in supporting Singapore, especially during our formative years. In 1960, a UNDP (United Nations Delegation Programme) delegation led by Dr Albert Winsemius first came to take a look at Singapore. I suspect he also came to get a feel for the leaders of Singapore at that point in time. He assisted us in developing an economic plan. Dr Winsemius eventually became far more than a consultant, but a stalwart friend and partner of our founding leaders. He later became the chief economic adviser to the Singapore Government. Just as we had that wonderful relationship and partnership with Dr Winsemius, we are also grateful to have received technical assistance in almost every sector, including (from) experts and trainers from the United Nations\u2019 (UN) specialised agencies, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank and other countries.\nWe established the SCP in 1992, 30 years ago, as a way for us to give back \u2013 or perhaps another way of looking at it is to pay (it) forward \u2013 to the international community for the assistance that we received in our early years. The SCP has quite rightly focused on enhancing capacity-building in our fellow developing countries, in particular through human resource development. We hope that by sharing our journey, our partners from around the world can learn from our experiences, both good and tough, which they can adapt to their own circumstances in order to make a positive impact to the lives of their own people.\nThe world today is confronted by an almost perfect storm of multiple overlapping, mutually synchronised, and even a vicious cycle of urgent challenges that range the gamut, from global health and infectious diseases to climate change, rising sea levels, the disruption caused by digital technologies and of course, the geostrategic picture with contestation, rivalry, and even war in some parts of our world.\nNow, more than ever, we need global solidarity, we need international cooperation if we are to rise to the challenges of our time, in particular in dealing with the global commons. In her message just now, you heard the UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who very aptly touched on how deeper cooperation amongst countries is crucial for our collective recovery from the current set of crises. Singapore\u2019s survival is intrinsically linked to global peace and stability. The SCP underscores our belief that international cooperation is not a zero-sum game, but mutually beneficial. When our region is peaceful, prosperous, and collectively committed to a sustainable future, we will also create social and economic opportunities for all our people. By working collectively, we strengthen our ability to deal with the immense shared challenges of the future. None of us can address these successfully alone.\nCOVID-19 also reminded us that none of us are safe, until all of us are safe. Through the SCP, we have forged many friendships across the world and in our own small way, contributed as a responsible and constructive member of the international community. I am glad that over the last three decades, close to 150,000 foreign officials have participated in a variety of SCP courses, including 88,000 from our ASEAN partner member states. I am heartened to hear the ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Lim Jock Hoi in his affirmation of the SCP\u2019s contribution to capacity building within ASEAN itself. More than 100,000 officials have participated in SCP courses held in Singapore, while others have also attended SCP courses in other parts of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.\nClimate change is a clear and pressing priority for all of us, especially for a low-lying city island state like ours. It is an existential issue. It requires collective global action. Singapore firmly believes that multilateral cooperation to tackle the problems of the global commons is absolutely essential. It should not surprise you, therefore, that we are strong supporters of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Glasgow Climate Pact. Personally, it is one of the highlights of my career to have spent years on the negotiating circuit that led up to the Paris Agreement. You should not be surprised, therefore, to know that Singapore is totally committed to do our part at the United Nations Climate Change Conference talks and at COP-27 in Sharm el-Sheikh next month. Earlier this morning, you may have heard Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Lawrence Wong, who announced that we will enhance our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We aim to peak our emissions earlier, and we will cut our CO2 emissions from 65 million tonnes to 60 million tonnes in 2030. This, I believe, will put us in very good stead to achieve our longer-term goal of getting to net zero by 2050.\nIt is against this backdrop that the SCP will give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda. I am pleased, therefore, to announce the launch of a new Sustainability Action Package (SAP). This package will support capacity building for developing countries, focused on sustainability and climate change. The package aims to help countries decarbonise and will include key areas on sustainability, including strategies to build resilience for water resources and food security, managing and financing green projects, developing sustainable infrastructure, and managing carbon markets. It will also sponsor longer-term advisory projects in Southeast Asia to deepen our capabilities on sustainability in our region. We welcome partners to contribute knowledge; to bring in your networks with international organisations and other Third Countries to partner us in implementing the SAP.\nLet me conclude by acknowledging the contributions and hard work of the people who have made the SCP a success. To all our Singapore agencies and training partners who deftly pivoted to virtual programmes during the recent COVID-19 pandemic; to all our foreign partners who have been instrumental in the organisation of our programmes, including within your own countries; to past and present staff in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 (MFA) Technical Cooperation Directorate, as well as our colleagues in the Missions abroad, who have worked so closely with foreign partners to maintain our relationships with our alumni. To our SCP participants, past, present and future \u2013 I hope you understand that you are lifelong friends, and that you will take the knowledge, experiences and network of relationships back home with you, even as you tackle your challenges in the present and in the future.\nSince this is the 30th year, I should also acknowledge the presence of Mr Peter Chan, who was our Permanent Secretary 30 years ago when we launched this programme. Peter, in his usual humble way, has also credited Simon Tay for being the external instigator and \u201cnagger\u201d who persuaded him and the management 30 years ago.\nMy friends, this is an occasion to celebrate, an occasion to renew friendships, and a reminder to all of us that by paying it forward (and) working collectively together, we can make a difference, we can overcome the challenges of the present and arrive ultimately, at an even better world for all of us. Thank you all very much for joining us.\nFACTSHEET ON THE SINGAPORE COOPERATION PROGRAMME (SCP) AND THE SUSTAINABILITY ACTION PACKAGE (SAP)\nEstablished in 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) is Singapore\u2019s flagship platform for extending technical assistance to fellow developing countries.\n2 The SCP was founded on the belief that human resource development is key to nation-building. It focuses on capacity-building while encouraging developing countries to share their development experiences and learn from one another.\n3 The SCP has hosted close to 150,000 officials from more than 180 countries and territories as well as international and regional organisations. SCP works with more than 50 local and international partners to conduct over 300 programmes yearly. Since 2015, all SCP programmes are aligned with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which serve as a useful road map for countries in their development journey.\n4 To mark the SCP\u2019s 30th anniversary, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan launched the Sustainability Action Package (SAP) on 25 October 2022. The SAP aims to support the capacity-building needs of developing countries on sustainability and climate change. It builds on the Climate Action Package (CAP) and will have a broader focus on sustainability. The CAP was established in 2018 and will conclude in March 2023.\n5 The SAP, which will run for three years (2023 \u2013 2026), comprises capacity-building programmes that cover a wide range of sustainability themes such as adaptation and resilience-building strategies, green project management and financing, low carbon development and carbon markets. The programmes will bring together diverse knowledge partners from the public and private sectors, and non-profit and international organisations to share best practices on tackling sustainability and climate issues.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at a reception to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Singapore Cooperation Programme, 25 October 2022\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan commemorating a toast to the Singapore Cooperation Programme with Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sim Ann, Former Permanent Secretary (Foreign Affairs) Peter Chan and Ambassador-At-Large Professor Tommy Koh, 25 October 2022\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sim Ann interacting with Singapore Cooperation Programme participants at the SCP30 exhibition, 25 October 2022\nPhoto Credits: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

It is a pleasure to be back in Ramallah. First, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Hawazi for all his hard work as our Representative to the Palestinian Authority these past six years. He has been tireless in promoting closer engagement. I would also like to express our sincere appreciation to Ms Shireen Shelleh for agreeing to take up the appointment of Honorary Director of our Singapore Representative Office here in Ramallah. She will be supporting the work of Hawazi and be our local point of contact.\nTechnical assistance has been a key component of Singapore\u2019s development journey. We believe that the sharing of best practices and facilitating knowledge transfer are effective means of contributing to international development. This approach was borne out of our own experience post-independence. As a resource-scarce country, Singapore\u2019s economic success is largely due to the generosity of our partners in the international community who were open to sharing their technical know-how and expertise with us. It is for this reason that we established the Singapore Cooperation Programme, or the SCP, to pay it forward. The SCP provides a platform which focuses on capacity-building and encourages fellow developing partners to share their development experiences and best practices and learn from one another. The SCP focuses on human capital development and is underpinned by our belief that our most valuable asset is our human resource. While we recognise that we all have our own unique circumstances, we hope that others will take away useful knowledge and practices to apply and adapt to their own situation. And in the process, Singapore also learns from the experience of others as we continue to improve ourselves.\nEven though Singapore is thousands of kilometers away from Ramallah, we are committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority\u2019s capacity-building efforts, where relevant and within our own means. Over the years, we have ramped up our technical assistance to the Palestinians. In 2013, we put together an Enhanced Technical Assistance Package, or ETAP, which gives Palestinian officials preferential placement in the capacity-building programmes offered under the SCP, and also customised study visits among others. When my Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited Ramallah in 2016, he announced the doubling of the ETAP pledge quantum to S$10 million. I am pleased to note that since its inception, more than 600 Palestinian officials have benefitted from the ETAP by participating in courses on Public Administration, Technical and Vocational Education and Training, and Economic Development.\nAs Hawazi mentioned earlier, Singapore hosted a study visit for a Palestinian delegation from the TVET Commission and Nablus University for Vocational and Technical Education in August 2022. While Singapore\u2019s experience might not be entirely replicable to the situation here, the delegation could adapt their observations to the Palestinians\u2019 unique requirements, particularly the importance of partnership between the TVET sector and industry players. We welcome more such study visits to Singapore.\nWhen COVID-19 struck and international travel came to a standstill, I am glad to note that PA officials continued to attend SCP courses online, with 120 participants in 2020 and 2021. At His Excellency Musa Abu Zaid\u2019s request, the SCP hosted a virtual three-day workshop on telecommuting in November 2021 to share strategies on building a hybrid work environment. This year, we welcomed 26 PA officials for 13 online courses, such as the \u201cStrategic Leadership and Public Governance\u201d programme in September. One of the participants found Singapore's perspective on Governance insightful and helpful, as the PA builds on a good governance model.\nI am pleased to note that since the Healthcare Assistance Package was presented to the PA this year, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore has run an online workshop on \u201cCombatting Public Health Challenges\u201d in August. The Civil Service College will also be customising a 5-day programme on \u201cPandemic Management\u201d for healthcare policy makers next month in Singapore. Participants will gain insights in identifying capabilities needed to strengthen policy and decision-making in responding to pandemics, which I hope will help the PA build resilience into its healthcare systems.\nWe have also worked closely with the Palestinian Authority to offer scholarships under our ETAP to Palestinian officials to pursue postgraduate studies in Singapore, in areas that are of relevance to the Palestinian Authority such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, or STEM, and International Relations. I am proud to note that Singapore has disbursed 11 scholarships thus far. Personally, I have had the privilege of meeting many of the Palestinians who have come to Singapore to participate in our programmes under the SCP. I enjoy hearing their observations on what they find interesting about life in Singapore, their interactions with Singaporeans and the attractions they like to visit. But of course, they did a lot of work, apart from visiting the attractions. I also learnt much from them about their lives in the West Bank and how they intended to apply what they have learnt in their courses to their jobs back here. I look forward to catching up with some of them this evening over dinner.\nAs Hawazi had mentioned earlier, the opening of a Representative Office in Ramallah is a key milestone in our relations with the Palestinian Authority. It is a testament to our commitment to doing more for the Palestinian Authority. It is my hope that the opening of the Office would lead to stronger links between Singapore and the Palestinians. We hope that our efforts can benefit the Palestinian people as they work towards the goal of an independent state, with Palestine and Israel living side-by-side in peace and security. I hope that you will also continue to support Hawazi and his work here, as well as extend your support to Shireen, and our new Representative Office.\nThe Representative Office and Shireen will assist Hawazi in our efforts to provide technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority by allowing for better coordination with the Palestinian agencies, the National Focal Point and the Singapore MFA. The Representative Office will help us better tailor the bilateral programmes to the needs of the Palestinian Authority and raise awareness of our various programmes. The Office could also help to identify more Palestinian officials to pursue their professional development in Singapore and use their stay in Singapore to get a better understanding of Asia. Shireen, on her part, will assist to identify opportunities for Singapore entities to share their expertise and experiences in line with the development priorities of the Palestinian Authority. We also hope to tap on her expertise and network to deepen the relationship between Singapore and the Palestinian Authority.\nWith this ladies and gentlemen, I declare opened the Singapore Representative Office in Ramallah.\nThank you.\nPhoto Caption:Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman with students at the Ramallah Friends School.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Meeting between Palestinian Authority Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Dr Riyad Al Malki and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Shtayyeh receiving Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman at Dr Shtayyeh\u2019s office.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman delivering his remarks at the opening ceremony of the Singapore Representative Office in Ramallah.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

I come from Singapore, a tiny city state at the heart of Southeast Asia. Singapore is uniquely positioned, but also exquisitely exposed, to both the opportunities and challenges presented by scientific, diplomatic and geopolitical developments which are occurring simultaneously all around us.\nScience as a Driving Force for Development\nLet me make a couple of points. First, we are on the cusp of another profound revolution and this is based on a very remarkable cocktail of simultaneous and mutually synergistic scientific breakthroughs in digital computation and communications, data science and artificial intelligence, biomedical sciences, which includes Genomics, gene editing, immunotherapy, synthetic biology, nanoscience and new materials, autonomous robotics, and renewable energy.\nWhat is unusual is that in each of these areas of platform technologies use, we are witnessing breakthrough. But they do not occur in isolation. A breakthrough in one area feeds into and sets up a virtuous cycle of acceleration in all the other adjacent fields. So, this is a profound moment of acceleration.\nThe second point, to look from context, is that the focal points, the parts of the globe where this acceleration of science efforts are, are not distributed uniformly. In some places, it is accelerating and there are also other places which may be left behind. It is critical for us to understand the underlying factors for these differences in outcomes.\nFor example, what is the optimal role for governments in supporting basic research, and realising value from its application? How should universities and research institutions be reorganised in this new age of discovery and innovation? How can the translation of discoveries into new products and services be accelerated? This involves governments playing a role not simply the regulator and a producer of rules but being a proactive enabler, providing the necessary frameworks and infrastructure for progress and excellence, and to translate this research into useful, and if I may add, ethical applications for commercialisation.\nThird point; are our current regimes for intellectual property protection and dissemination fit for purpose? Have we found the right balance between temporary monopolies for inventors and the dissemination of knowledge for wider exploitation? Equally important for governments, are innovations in the policy ecosystem \u2013 both national and global \u2013 that will bring together talent, money, and the necessary commercial and industrial players to enable innovation to flourish.\nFourth point is that we have all benefitted, I would say in the last century, from sharing a common, open stack of scientific discoveries based on that shared platform of research, methods, applications and technology. The reality is that today, we are now in danger of perhaps a technological bifurcation due to geopolitical conflict. This will have a profound impact on all of us because it will lead to a more divided world, characterised by slower progress, higher costs, greater contestation and increased risk of conflict.\nIn fact, we are already witnessing these effects, with supply chain disruptions, rising costs of living, inflation. Our countries today, in managing our supply chains, are thinking in terms of \u2018just in case\u2019 rather than \u2018just in time\u2019 and we see \u2018friend-shoring\u2019 in order to ensure continuity and resilience in supply chains.\nThe ripple effects of all this bifurcation goes beyond just science and technology. It risks the decoupling of global systems that have been the enablers of peace and stability for the last seventy-five years after the end of the second world war, and it raises therefore the prospect of a more fractured, more divided, less prosperous, and certainly less peaceful world.\nLessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIf I could just draw your attention to some of the early lessons from COVID-19. Treat this as a real-life worked example of the interplay between science, public policy and the extent of social cohesion and trust within societies. COVID-19 was not the first pandemic, and not even the most virulent pandemic that humanity has faced. Yet it is obvious that our global system for detection, prevention, preparedness and response had major gaps.\nThe global pandemic response highlighted the importance of governments and private sector working together to address global problems. At the outset of the pandemic, actually, the scientific community was able to get together, was able to publish the genome within weeks, was able to work single-mindedly towards devising diagnostics and even the development of vaccines in record time - in months rather than years, which you would normally take. That\u2019s the good news.\nBut the other half of the equation is that we also discovered that it was social capital within societies, in particular trust between citizens and trust between citizens and the government and scientific authorities that made a critical difference for outcomes. Many people died, even in wealthy societies, not for lack of vaccines or treatment facilities, but because of misinformation, political polarisation, which adversely influenced behaviour at both the individual and community level.\nSingapore and Switzerland played a role in co-chairing the Friends of the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility. Together with other like-minded partners, we pioneered the term \u2018vaccine multilateralism\u2019, which encouraged others to join this collective global effort to ensure the unimpeded, fair, and equitable distribution of vaccines.\nBut yet, on this point, it is noteworthy that by the middle of this year, vaccine supply at the global level was no longer a limiting factor. Today, if Switzerland or Singapore was to offer free vaccines from our excess stock, no country is willing to accept. Think about that.\nThe Case for Multilateralism\nI have offered a rather sobering assessment of our world today. But my intention is not to cause alarm or assign blame, but rather for us to acknowledge the challenge before us, and to underscore the intent and the need to double down, double down on multilateralism and to effect a concerted global response equal to scale of its challenge.\nAt the same time, these challenges have also brought unprecedented opportunities. The dramatic advances in science and technology offer new ways of solving major challenges of our generation. If we can harness these advancements, if we can mitigate the unwanted downsides, and distribute the benefits more equally across our globe \u2013 then we hold the keys to a better future.\nOur belief is that the only way forward is to uphold an inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten global peace, progress and prosperity for the last 75 to 80 years.\nSmall states, like Singapore, and even Switzerland, have agency and we have a critical role to play. That is why we work together with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States, in 1992. Groupings such as FOSS. Today we account for 108 members in the UN, that is the majority of the UN General Assembly membership.\nAs we celebrate the 30th anniversary of FOSS, my hope is that the world can come together \u2013 combining both deft diplomacy and the tremendous potential offered by the inexorable march of science and technological progress to chart a brighter, more prosperous, and cohesive future.\nSo therefore, I stand here in support of the GESDA Agenda, I stand here in support of the agenda outlined by President Cassis, and to make the point that we need to establish the network of people who have both mastery of science and diplomacy, and to make a difference, by making common cause and especially at this time of historic opportunity and risk.\nThank you all very much.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering a speech at the GESDA Summit in Geneva, 14 October 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan on a panel discussion at the GESDA Summit with Alexandre Fasel (Moderator), Special Representative for Science Diplomacy in Geneva, Switzerland; Ignazio Cassis, President of the Swiss Confederation and Head of the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs; Sarah bint Yousef Al Amiri, Minister of State for Public Education and Advanced Technology, United Arab Emirates; and Martina Hirayama, State Secretary for Education, Research and Innovation, Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research of Switzerland, 14 October 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Swiss President Ignazio Cassis at the GESDA Summit in Geneva, 14 October 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

The text of the speech is appended.\nDuring the visit, SMS also met Icelandic Minister for Foreign Affairs \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan Reykfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Gylfad\u00f3ttir, Icelandic Minister for Infrastructure Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson, Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Angus Robertson, and Arctic Circle Chairman \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n14 OCTOBER 2022\n14 OCTOBER 2022\nREMARKS BY SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE (SMS), MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE ASSEMBY, 13 OCTOBER 2022\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Speakers,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI am delighted and honoured to join all of you at the Arctic Circle Assembly (ACA) today. Since the inaugural ACA in 2013, Singapore has participated in every ACA. I am therefore glad that we continue to be able to partake in the important discussions at this forum this year.\nYou might ask \u2013 why is Singapore an Arctic Council Observer despite being located on the Equator, more than 7,000 km away from the Arctic? The reality is that what happens in the Arctic has a profound and significant impact on a small island state like Singapore.\nAbout 30% of Singapore is less than five metres above sea level, making our country vulnerable to rising seas caused by a warming planet. A recent study revealed that over the past four decades, the Arctic region has warmed at a rate that was nearly four times faster than the rest of the world. The Arctic region is now roughly 3\u00baC warmer than in 1980. Another study suggested that even if humans were to stop emitting greenhouse gases today, the current warming would have caused Greenland\u2019s ice sheets to lose 3.3% of its volume, which would contribute to a 27.4cm rise in sea level.\nFor small low-lying island states like Singapore \u2013 and others including Iceland - climate change is an existential challenge. That is why it is even more important today for Singapore to work and support multilateral institutions like the Arctic Council, and platforms like today\u2019s Arctic Circle Assembly, to find actionable solutions to combat the effects of climate change.\nSingapore\u2019s carbon footprint is small \u2013 we account for around 0.11% of global carbon emissions, and rank 126th out of 142 countries in terms of CO2 emissions per dollar GDP (according to data from the International Energy Agency) About 95% of our electricity is generated from natural gas \u2013 the cleanest fossil fuel \u2013 and we have implemented policies to cap vehicle growth and manage vehicular emissions. However, we are not complacent and continue to make significant efforts in our green efforts. Last year, we launched a national sustainability movement, the Singapore Green Plan, to chart ambitious and concrete green targets over the next 10 years. This will position us to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspirations as soon as viable. Towards this end, we have announced this year that we will raise our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around 2050.\nAmongst our many initiatives that touch almost every dimension of our lives in transitioning to a low-carbon future, Singapore is actively studying and investing in advanced low-carbon solutions such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies, and hydrogen. We plan to quadruple local solar production from 2020 levels by 2025. In July last year, Singapore opened the world\u2019s first inland floating solar panel farms. The annual carbon emission reduction accrued is equivalent to taking 7,000 cars off the road.\nInnovation is key for a small country like Singapore, and we also look to collaborating with innovative like-minded Arctic partners to find solutions to address pressing issues with global implications, such as the accelerated warming of the Arctic and climate change. Singapore\u2019s Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), such as the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University, have in place comprehensive memorandums of understanding with IHLs with expertise on the Arctic.\nOur IHLs also undertake research in Arctic technology, including studying the re-adaptation of off-grid energy solutions, that have been used in rural communities in Southeast Asia, to be used to benefit remote communities in the Arctic. Of note, the National University of Singapore\u2019s Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine contains a deep ocean water basin facility which has the potential for Arctic research applicability. We also set up the Centre for Climate Research Singapore to enhance our understanding of climate science, including how climate change in the Arctic affects polar ice sheets.\nIn May 2022, a Singapore delegation from the Nanyang Technological University went on an expedition visit to research centres and observatories in Svalbard, Norway. The team was looking to expand areas of collaboration and had planned to utilise the satellite imagery to study the impact of climate change and sea level rise in the Tropics. I am certain that we will see many more of such meaningful and impactful Arctic-Tropics collaboration in the future.\nBeyond our current collaboration, Singapore is keen to step up cooperation with many Arctic States in managing the negative effects of climate change. You can count on Singapore as a committed friend, partner and champion for the Arctic region. Thank you.\nSenior Minister of State Sim Ann delivering her opening address at the opening session of the Arctic Circle Forum\nPhoto Credit: Arctic Circle\nMeeting between Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Icelandic Minister for Foreign Affairs \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan Reykfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Gylfad\u00f3ttir\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMeeting between Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Icelandic Minister for Infrastructure Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMeeting between Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Angus Robertson\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

Our Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) have to respond swiftly and astutely to emerging developments around the world that have consequential impact on Singapore\u2019s national interests and the well-being of Singaporeans. Young FSOs are given opportunities to represent Singapore early in their careers through engagement with foreign counterparts at international conferences like the United Nations General Assembly and ASEAN meetings and postings to Overseas Missions. It is thus critical that we continue to recruit top talent to join the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) with the necessary attributes to operate in a complex, volatile global environment.\nMFA continually reviews our career schemes to meet the challenges posed by the increased competition for talent. Foreign Service Officers are in demand in many other fields, including the private sector, because of their training, experience and versatility. We review our Foreign Service remuneration package regularly to ensure that we remain competitive.\nWe will continue to actively recruit top talent through our outreach programmes and internships conducted in MFA\u2019s HQ and at our Overseas Missions. Beyond tangible elements, it is the honour of representing our nation and sense of fulfilment that motivates all MFA officers.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 OCTOBER 2022"

Minister Balakrishnan underscored the urgent need for concerted global cooperation in the face of multiple concurrent crises. Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold multilateralism, the UN Charter and international law. Multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Countries should collectively strengthen the UN and the multilateral system to address these new challenges and opportunities. Minister Balakrishnan outlined three areas in the global commons where there is an urgent need to enhance resilience \u2013 climate change and food insecurity; global health and pandemic preparedness; and digital transformation and cybersecurity. The transcript of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s national statement is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 25 SEPTEMBER 2022\nNATIONAL STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, NEW YORK, 24 SEPTEMBER 2022 Multilateralism and International Law for a World in Crisis Mr President, Excellencies,\nLet me first congratulate His Excellency Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si on assuming the Presidency of the 77th session of the General Assembly. I also commend His Excellency Abdulla Shahid for his stalwart leadership of the 76th session during what was a most challenging year. This (General) Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple concurrent crises. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international law and the UN Charter and undermines the rules-based order. We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of even more Ukrainian territory. The multilateral system, which has contributed so greatly to global peace and security, is now being severely tested. At the same time, superpower rivalry continues to sharpen. As we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year, the risks of accidents, miscalculations, confrontation, and even outright conflict have escalated. The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation to resort to unilateralism has become even stronger. But the need for global cooperation has never been greater or more urgent, given the range of transnational challenges that all of us confront today. Our recovery from COVID-19 remains uneven and fragile. The risk of a future and even more deadly pandemic has risen. The global economy is entering a period characterised by higher and prolonged inflation, and we see high interest rates all over the world. Energy prices have soared. It will become harder to generate the resources all of us need in order to address these long-term problems. Societies everywhere will have to grapple with greater internal division, disruption, and polarisation. Without that sense of cohesion, unity, trust, or even an ability to agree on facts, the will and unity needed for societies to confront these existential challenges will be undermined considerably. The climate crisis is a clear and present threat. Our global commons including water and biodiversity are also deteriorating rapidly. Our global food supply is at risk. To make things worse, all these threats and crises are occurring concurrently; interacting with and compounding each other in a vicious circle. For instance, the Secretary-General has spoken of a triple crisis (of) food, fuel, and finance. The impact of these simultaneous crises on ordinary people and on our livelihoods has been severe, and all the more so in developing countries. We see this in the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan and in parts of Africa. The post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity has unfortunately come to an end. A new world order is being born and any obstetrician here will tell you the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous. Will we have a more divided, less prosperous, and less peaceful world? Or instead, can we strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future, uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system, and jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies, including digital technology, synthetic biology and customised healthcare, and renewable energy. If we can do this, we can then create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone. Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since World War II. This is also why we have worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States (FOSS). We did so in 1992. We started small with only 16 countries. This year, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of FOSS. We now have a 108 countries \u2013 a majority at the UN \u2013 we are all proud members. FOSS has always been a champion of the UN and rules-based multilateralism. It gives us a collective stake and voice in the global commons, a means to safeguard our interests, and a system where we have sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully in accordance with international law. Indeed, the profound importance of multilateralism and international law is precisely why Singapore condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The security and even existence of Singapore \u2013 and many other countries, and especially small states \u2013 depends on the international community upholding the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. If we do not protect these principles, there is then no basis for countries \u2013 big and small \u2013 to cooperate on an equal footing. Small states especially must not allow the world to regress to one where \u2018might is right\u2019. While the rules-based multilateral system is not perfect, it is by far our best option in addressing transnational challenges and managing the global commons. This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 40 years ago. It brought order and predictability to the governance of the oceans and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together. The geopolitical reality today makes it harder to forge consensus on such a framework. But as our experience with COVID-19 has shown, multilateral cooperation is the only way forward. Ultimately, we share one planet. Despite all our differences, our destinies are inter-woven, and no one is safe until all of us are safe. This applies for pandemics, it also applies for climate change, the conservation of the oceans, and all our other shared challenges. Singapore will do our part. We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee serves as the President of the BBNJ Conference (Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction), which is currently negotiating a treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We call on all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust and future-proof BBNJ treaty. There is much more that we can do to re-energise and transform the UN-based multilateral system to new realities and challenges. I commend the leadership of the Secretary-General in putting forth a bold and ambitious \u201cCommon Agenda\u201d to do so. Let me focus on just three areas in our global commons where there is an urgent need to build resilience: climate change and food insecurity, global health and pandemic preparedness, and digital transformation and cybersecurity. Climate Change and Food Insecurity Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting humanity today, as we have seen from the more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and the devastation that they have wrought world over. We need a sustained and ambitious global response. Continued commitment by all countries to the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact \u2013 that is absolutely critical. We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero. This will be the biggest socio-economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. Both will require considerable economic restructuring, technological breakthroughs, investments, and behavioural changes. The UN-led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone behind. Singapore, as a small, low-lying, alternative-energy disadvantaged island nation, is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea-levels. Singapore\u2019s impact on global emissions is infinitely small, but we take our climate change action obligations very seriously. We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. A comprehensive strategy to green our economy is taking shape, and we will raise carbon taxes progressively from 2024. We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero. We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia. We are also building capabilities in environmental risk management in the financial sector and providing grants to defray the costs of green and sustainability-linked loans and bonds. An adjacent issue is food insecurity. Climate change, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat to our food security. According to a UN report, as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger last year \u2014 that is 46 million more than 2020 and 150 million more than 2019. We must reverse this negative trend. First, we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly. Second, we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges. For example, working together to develop climate-resilient food systems, whilst developing the necessary precautions for food safety. There is much scope for multilateral cooperation on capacity-building and the development of global norms and standards. Global Health Architecture and Pandemic Preparedness Next \u2014 it is essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect our future generations. After COVID-19, there will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. In my view, COVID-19 was perhaps a full dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come. We must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess, and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion in (the) future. We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding under-investment in pandemic preparedness, amongst other global public goods. Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen the global health security system. We will continue to support the COVAX Facility, and we have contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response hosted by the World Bank. Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity Lastly, we must enhance international cooperation to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution. Digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum. It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues \u2014 geopolitical tensions, technological bifurcation, cybersecurity threats, and the digital divide. The world has made significant progress by developing based on a single shared technology stack. Interconnectedness (and) interoperability has brought us together, lowered costs, (and) spurred innovation and competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas. But if we fracture our world and our technology stack, all that good work and that speed of progress and innovation will be slowed down significantly. We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and optimise the opportunities of digital transformation, while effectively addressing all its challenges. A zero-sum, exclusionary, bifurcated approach benefits no one. An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyber threats and malicious cyber activities. We must also ensure that all States, particularly small states, developing and least developed countries benefit from the digital revolution and not be left behind. Singapore fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal for a Global Digital Compact, which has received strong support from Member States. We are honoured that Ambassador Burhan Gafoor serves as Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. The consensus adoption of the Working Group\u2019s first Annual Progress Report in July is a welcome sign that multilateralism is alive and well, and can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons even in these difficult times. Mr President, Excellencies, To conclude \u2014 this is a moment where multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism, including especially adherence to the UN Charter and international law. I remain an optimist in these difficult times and I believe that we are actually on the cusp of an era of profound technological breakthroughs, one that will equip humanity with unimaginably powerful new tools. It is in the world\u2019s interest \u2013 and in our own national long-term interest \u2013 to set aside our differences, address the challenges of the global commons, and to harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies. Ultimately, as Member States, we have as much responsibility to each other and to our citizens: to work together, to improve, adapt, and strengthen the multilateral system that we have built so painstakingly over the past 77 years, so that our people \u2013 all people \u2013 can lead better, more secure, more peaceful, and happier lives. Thank you Mr President, Excellencies.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s National Statement at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 24 September 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s National Statement at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 24 September 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

        "content": "The Global Governance Group (3G)[1], held its 15th Ministerial Meeting in New York on 21 September 2022 on the sidelines of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). At the 3G\u2019s invitation, the G20 Troika (previous, present and incoming Presidencies) \u2013 Italy, Indonesia and India \u2013 joined the 3G Foreign Ministers to discuss ways to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation in the face of unprecedented global challenges today. The 3G convenes this annual meeting with the G20 Troika to promote a more inclusive, accountable and effective global governance framework. Indonesia, in its capacity as the 2022 G20 Presidency, updated the 3G Ministers on the progress made at key G20 meetings thus far, as well as deliverables for the G20 Summit in Bali on 15 and 16 November 2022. The 3G Ministers welcomed Indonesia\u2019s salient G20 Presidency agenda centred on three thematic pillars: \u201cGlobal Health Architecture\u201d, \u201cSustainable Energy Transition\u201d and \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d, under the theme of \u201cRecover Together, Recover Stronger\u201d. The 3G Ministers commended Indonesia\u2019s leadership in spearheading the G20\u2019s response to myriad challenges facing the international community today, including food and energy insecurity, climate change, rising inflation and supply chain disruption. The 3G Ministers welcomed, inter alia, the good progress in the various G20 tracks and working groups, as well as the G20\u2019s commitment to promote sustainable and inclusive post-pandemic economic recovery and development, including by addressing climate change, leveraging digitalisation, supporting the clean energy transition, narrowing the global development gap, and accelerating the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with a focus on developing and vulnerable countries. Geopolitical developments and conflicts have placed the multilateral system and its institutions under tremendous strain. In this regard, the 3G Ministers expressed their unequivocal and unwavering support for an inclusive and rules-based multilateral system with the UN at its core. They reaffirmed, inter alia, the UN Charter\u2019s principles of sovereign equality and peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as the essentiality of dialogue and diplomacy to solve disputes without armed conflict. The 3G Ministers expressed concern over global supply chain disruptions and rising protectionist tendencies, which will continue to hamper the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. They stressed the need to ensure the resilience and sustainability of supply chain and emphasised the continued importance of promoting and abiding by an open, predictable, rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system underpinned by the World Trade Organization (WTO), to ensure unimpeded cross-border flows of essential goods, including food, energy, vaccines and medicines. The 3G Ministers welcomed, inter alia, the G20\u2019s commitment made at the G20 Digital Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 1 September 2022 to leverage digitalisation for a stronger, inclusive and collaborative post-pandemic global economic order. They also welcomed the continued support to all vulnerable countries, expressed during the Third G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting on 15-16 July 2022, to ensure that we all recover together and stronger, including the call for further pledges of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent voluntary contributions, for recommendations to unlock significant amounts of development financing through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and for multilateral coordination to take swift action to respond to countries\u2019 requests for debt treatment. The 3G Ministers reiterated the need for continued efforts to strengthen global pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, including by improving national health systems and health infrastructure, ensuring safe, affordable and equitable vaccine access for all, and expanding vaccine production globally, including in developing countries, through appropriate dissemination of technology and know-how in accordance with World Trade Organization rules. They applauded the establishment of a Financial Intermediary Fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response hosted by the World Bank, which built on the strong foundation laid by the 2021 Italian G20 Presidency on the issue and the work of the G20 High Level Independent Panel on Financing the Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. The 3G Ministers reiterated their support for multilateral initiatives that facilitated the achievements towards reaching these aims, such as the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) and the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). The 3G Ministers welcomed the G20\u2019s continued engagement of non-G20 members, such as the 3G, to strengthen multilateralism and global governance by opening up the G20 process to diverse voices from across the UN membership. As Indonesia continues to deliver on its G20 agenda this year, the 3G Ministers looked forward to continuing the good and constructive partnership with the G20 on salient issues facing the international community. They encouraged India to continue the G20\u2019s strong engagement of the 3G and other regional and international organisations, in particular the UN, in implementing initiatives and strategies, and contributing to common goals on peace, stability and sustainable development. The 3G Ministers emphasised the importance of ensuring inclusiveness, coherence and complementarity when establishing global standards and galvanising collective action on shared challenges.\n21 SEPTEMBER 2022 [1] The 3G comprises the following Member States of the United Nations: Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, San Marino, Senegal, Singapore, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam."

        "content": "QUESTIONS\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) to what extent has the ongoing crisis in Myanmar affected the credibility of ASEAN in promoting peace and stability in the region; and (b) whether ASEAN is considering a joint effort to engage the Myanmar leadership at the highest levels.\nMr Gerald Giam Yean SongTo ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of the Myanmar military government\u2019s failure to implement the Five-Point Consensus on Myanmar reached with ASEAN in 2021, whether Singapore plans to work with ASEAN to (i) implement targeted sanctions on Myanmar\u2019s military, including an arms embargo and imposing travel restrictions on members of the military and (ii) establish contact with, and provide assistance, to the National Unity Government.\nREPLY\nThe coup in Myanmar was launched by the Myanmar military or the Tatmadaw on 1 February 2021. Since then, the tragic consequences arising from the coup, which include large scale civilian deaths and injuries, have continued with no sign of abatement. The situation remains dire. The primary responsibility for the ongoing crisis in Myanmar lies with the Tatmadaw\nThe Five-Point Consensus was formulated by the ASEAN Leaders and accepted by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing at their meeting on 24 April 2021 in Jakarta. However, Singapore and ASEAN are deeply disappointed that there has been little progress in its implementation. This is despite efforts by successive Special Envoys of the ASEAN Chair \u2013 Brunei and Cambodia \u2013 and direct entreaties by current ASEAN Chair, Cambodia. Instead, aerial bombings of opposition-controlled areas and the execution of opposition activists have occurred. The timings of these actions by the Tatmadaw underscore their disregard for both ASEAN and the Five-Point Consensus\nMyanmar\u2019s peace, security and stability is not only in its own interest but also for the whole region. However, without political reconciliation and dialogue in good faith by all stakeholders, the necessary political solution cannot be found. The setbacks to ASEAN\u2019s efforts are not a matter of ASEAN credibility, but rather of the Tatmadaw\u2019s intransigence. The ASEAN Leaders will have to assess the progress in the Five-Point Consensus\u2019 implementation at the ASEAN Summits this November. Depending on how the situation evolves, they will have to make some difficult decisions to guide ASEAN\u2019s next steps.\nSingapore voted in favour of UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/75/287 \u201cThe Situation in Myanmar\u201d in June 2021, which calls on UN Member States to \u201cprevent the flow of arms into Myanmar\u201d. Since April 2022, Singapore has not authorised the transfer of items assessed to have potential military application to Myanmar, where there is a serious risk that the item may be used to inflict violence against unarmed civilians. This is in line with our firm commitment to measures that will facilitate the de-escalation of violence in Myanmar and support efforts by ASEAN and the UN to achieve a negotiated political solution.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n13 SEPTEMBER 2022"

Increased geopolitical tensions have exacerbated food and energy supply concerns and resulted in decades-high inflation. The consequences are most keenly felt by developing countries.\nThe focus this morning is hence extremely salient: strengthening the resilience of developing countries against future crises and promoting innovative financing mechanisms can prevent the reversal of decades of progress, and help them achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs.\nLet me share four areas we should focus on.\nDigital Transformation\nFirst, the pandemic has shown the importance of technology. Those with access to the internet and digital tools could pivot online and mitigate the impact of border closures and societal lockdowns. Hence, we must support developing countries in bridging the digital divide to truly recover together and stronger. This includes digitally equipping MSMEs and improving digital literacy and access in developing countries.\nSupply Chain Resilience\nSecond, we must strengthen supply chain resilience to ensure that medicines and essential goods get to where they are most needed, including developing countries.\nInnovative Financing Mechanisms\nThird, according to a recent OECD report, the funding gap to meet the SDGs is 3.7 trillion US dollars. Public funding alone cannot meet this demand. Hence, alignment of interests between public and private capital through blended finance is crucial. For the private sector, investment returns in sustainability projects do not often commensurate with the risks. Collaboration between the public sector, multilateral banks, and philanthropic sources can provide critical de-risking and improve project bankability, which could bring in further private sector funding.\nGreen Transformation\nFourth, to ensure a better future for our next generation, sustainable energy transition is important.\nHowever, our efforts must remain pragmatic. As we de-carbonise our industries, transition fuels will continue to be necessary in the short to medium term, particularly for developing countries. Any sudden shift will cause disruptions to an already-volatile energy situation.\nColleagues, we are encouraged by the G20\u2019s commitment to assist developing countries. In particular, Singapore commends the Indonesian G20 Presidency for its tireless efforts, which led to the successful conclusion of two outcome documents on development issues, namely, the G20 Principles for Scaling Up Blended Finance, and the G20 Roadmap for Stronger Recovery and Resilience in Developing Countries.\nThis sends an important signal to the international community on G20\u2019s leadership role. Singapore looks forward to working together with the G20 to build a better future for all.\nThank you Minister Suharso.\nMINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE, SECOND MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN\u2019S INTERVENTION AT PLENARY SESSION TWO, \u2018REINVIGORATING GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO MULTILATERALISM FOR TIMELY DELIVERY OF SDG ACHIEVEMENTS\u2019 AT THE 2022 G20 DEVELOPMENT MINISTERIAL MEETING IN BELITUNG, INDONESIA\nBapak Suharso\nColleagues,\nPre-pandemic, the international community was already behind schedule in assisting developing countries in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising tensions between major powers, leading to increased supply chain concerns and soaring inflation, have set this back even further. Effective multilateralism is needed more than ever to achieve the SDGs by 2030.\nFirst, we must continue to uphold a rules-based international order that places the United Nations Charter at its core and recognises the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.\nSecond, multilateralism must remain inclusive to all countries. Singapore established the Forum of Small States and the Global Governance Group so that the voices of small- and medium-sized states, including developing ones, can be heard.\nThird, we must overcome our differing views and work together to tackle issues of international concern, for example, strengthening global pandemic preparedness and response, and preventing a climate crisis. No country can do so alone.\nToday, we stand at a crossroad with eight years left to 2030. We thank the Italian and Indonesian G20 Presidencies for providing the crucial momentum to advance progress on the SDGs through the G20 Development Ministerial Meetings.\nSingapore remains committed to supporting fellow developing countries in this endeavour by tailoring our capacity-building programmes. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, Singapore has trained over 137,000 foreign government officials over thirty years in areas such as sustainable development and disaster management. We are happy to work with the G20 in these efforts.\nThank you.\nSingapore Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman attending the G20 Development Ministerial Meeting, 8 September 2022.\nPhoto CreditsMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister for National Development Planning of Indonesia Suharso Monoarfa\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministerial Meeting, 8 September 2022.\nPhoto CreditsMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Japan Takei Shunsuke\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministerial Meeting, 8 September 2022.\nPhoto CreditsMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Second Minister for Education Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Minister of Economy and Planning of Saudi Arabia Faisal Fadel Al Ibrahim\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Development Ministerial Meeting, 8 September 2022.\nPhoto CreditsMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

She was, and will forever continue to be, a wellspring of strength and inspiration not just for the British people but also for the people in the Commonwealth and beyond. She will be fondly remembered for dedicating her life to service during her long reign, overseeing a period of remarkable evolution in British society and the United Kingdom\u2019s role in the world. Her passing is an enormous loss to us all.\nHer Majesty made three visits to Singapore following our independence \u2013 in 1972, 1989, and 2006 \u2013 where her warmth and kindness won the hearts of Singaporeans from all walks of life. Her Majesty\u2019s grace and generosity were also keenly felt during the State Visit by former President Dr Tony Tan to London in 2014, where Her Majesty and Prince Philip hosted Dr Tan and Mrs Mary Tan at Buckingham Palace. Being the first-ever State Visit to the United Kingdom by a Singapore President, Her Majesty presided over a momentous occasion in our bilateral relations, and her State Banquet speech paid an inspiring tribute to the two centuries of shared history between Singapore and the United Kingdom, as well as Singapore\u2019s achievements on the eve of our 50th year of independence. All those who have met Her Majesty recall her grace, hospitality and good humour.\nHer Majesty will be greatly missed and her passing will be deeply felt by all in the Commonwealth, including Singapore. On behalf of the people of Singapore, my husband and I extend our most heartfelt condolences during this time of grief.\nYours sincerely,\nHALIMAH YACOB\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to His Majesty King Charles III\n9 September 2022\nYour Majesty,\nI was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your mother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\nHer Majesty The Queen was the very heart and soul of the United Kingdom. Her reign saw one of the longest periods of peace and prosperity in the United Kingdom. Throughout her life, she steadfastly served the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth with devotion, grace, and humility. Her Majesty was also a noted patron of numerous charities and an ardent supporter of the arts. She helped to raise billions in donations for the world\u2019s major causes, including cancer research, humanitarian aid, sports, the environment, education and training. Her Majesty\u2019s contributions to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and indeed to world affairs will be recorded in history, and she will always be remembered fondly as a great world leader.\nHer Majesty left a significant mark on Singapore\u2019s history and our longstanding relations with the United Kingdom. During her reign, our two countries celebrated many significant milestones. These included Singapore\u2019s hosting of the inaugural Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1971, the 150th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles\u2019 arrival in Singapore in 1969, as well as the State Visit by President Tony Tan to the United Kingdom in 2014.\nI am honoured to have met Her Majesty several times, most recently in London during the 2018 CHOGM. I warmly recall her State Visits to Singapore \u2013 in 1972, 1989 and 2006, especially the lunch I hosted for her at the Fullerton Hotel in 2006. Her Majesty always showed warmth and friendship through her natural affection and spontaneous good humour. Her visits never failed to draw huge crowds; Singaporeans welcomed The Queen enthusias\u00adtically when she toured our housing estates, schools and institutions, and other places of interest. Her passing is deeply mourned by all of us in Singapore.\nTo Her Majesty, service to the nation and the Commonwealth was an overriding priority in life. As we commemorate her reign, I have no doubt the world will long continue to draw inspiration and strength from Her Majesty\u2019s life story and contributions.\nOn behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend my sincerest condolences to you and all members of the Royal Family. The Queen will be remembered and missed dearly.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nHis Majesty King Charles III\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss\n9 September 2022\nDear Prime Minister Truss,\nOn behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you, and the Government and people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, my deepest condolences on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\nDuring her reign, the longest ever in British history, Her Majesty was deeply revered. She stood as a symbol of hope, stability, and continuity, not only for the British people, but all the peoples of the Commonwealth. Her Majesty\u2019s deep sense of duty, unwavering devotion and countless contributions over a lifetime have left an indelible mark on our collective history and inspired millions around the world, including Singaporeans. Being Head of the Commonwealth, her passing is a tremendous loss to the Commonwealth family.\nSingapore\u2019s own history is interwoven with the reign of Her Majesty. At 25, when Her Majesty ascended the throne as The Queen, Singapore was still a British Crown Colony. The new district of Queenstown was so named upon her coronation. Since our independence, we have been honoured to host Her Majesty\u2019s periodic visits to Singapore. During her State Visit in 1972, she witnessed our early nation-building efforts at the Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute and visited Toa Payoh, a new Housing Development Board estate. Over the years, Her Majesty maintained her fondness for and friendship with Singaporeans. On her third State Visit in 2006, she visited the same family she had met in Toa Payoh more than three decades earlier. Despite the many dramatic developments that Singapore had undergone since independence, the bonds of affection between our countries and peoples have endured with the constancy of Her Majesty\u2019s rule of the United Kingdom.\nOur bilateral ties also expanded and deepened significantly during Her Majesty\u2019s reign. The United Kingdom has remained a valued defence partner under the Five Power Defence Arrangements, and last year we were glad to welcome the HMS Queen Elizabeth II to our shores on its historic tour of the region. Our economic relations have prospered with the Bilateral Investment Treaty signed in 1975, and more recently, the landmark UK-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the Digital Economy Agreement. Today, more than 5,500 UK companies are based in Singapore. Our people-to-people links remain excellent, with the UK hosting the biggest Singaporean community in Europe, and British citizens among the top European visitors to Singapore, reflecting our strong shared cultural heritage.\nAs we commemorate Her Majesty\u2019s legacy, we also remember her indispensable role in steering the United Kingdom and the modern world through seven decades of peace and prosperity, her selfless commitment to the betterment of the Commonwealth and its peoples, and her pursuit of amity and cooperation among all nations of the world.\nYours sincerely,\nLee Hsien Loong\nThe Rt Honourable Elizabeth Truss MP\nPrime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, and Minister for the Union\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"

        "content": "Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Mr Sam Tan visited Nuuk, Greenland to attend the Arctic Circle Greenland Forum from 26 to 30 August 2022 as part of Singapore\u2019s ongoing engagement of the Arctic since becoming an observer state in the Arctic Council in 2013. The Arctic Circle Greenland Forum was attended by close to 400 speakers and participants from 15 countries, including government officials, representatives of the Arctic indigenous peoples, and members of the business and academic communities. Special Envoy Tan delivered a speech during the opening session on \u201cThe View from Asia\u201d, where he highlighted Singapore\u2019s contributions and participation in various Arctic initiatives over the years. Special Envoy Tan also took part in a panel discussion moderated by former President of the Republic of Iceland and Chairman of the Arctic Circle Assembly \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson. The text of the speech is appended.\nOn the sidelines of the Forum, Special Envoy Tan met Chairman Gr\u00edmsson as well as Iceland Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, Greenland Minister for Foreign Affairs, Business and Trade Vivian Motzfeldt, and Faroe Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture Jenis av Rana.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n30 SEPTEMBER\nREMARKS BY SPECIAL ENVOY FOR ARCTIC AFFAIRS SAM TAN AT THE ARCTIC GREENLAND FORUM ON \u201cTHE VIEW FROM ASIA\u201d, 27 AUGUST 2022\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Speakers,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n1. I am delighted to be back in Nuuk after 6 years, and to address the Arctic Circle Greenland Forum again.\n2. The topic for this segment is \u201cThe View from Asia\u201d. So, I will speak from the perspective of an Asian, and how a small country like Singapore is trying to contribute to the efforts of mitigating the challenges of global warming and Arctic melting. Asia is a vibrant region with enormous potentials. Today, Asia accounts for 40% of the world\u2019s GDP and is home to four of the world\u2019s ten largest economies. It also has more than half of the world\u2019s population.\n3. The world\u2019s economies have undergone rapid changes and become more integrated and inter-connected over the past few decades. With the signing of many multilateral FTAs, the most recent being the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) which is the world\u2019s largest FTA comprising 30% of global GDP, many Asian economies have become important global trading and investment partners.\n4. Apart from global economies, the global strategic outlook is also rapidly changing and getting more contentious and worrying. For example, we are seeing the escalation of conflicts and tensions in East Asia, Europe and Middle East. The resulting geopolitical tensions are not only felt keenly throughout these regions but also the rest of the world. These ongoing conflicts have also exacerbated the spike in food and energy prices and affected supply chains around the world. However, political and economic dynamics are not the only challenges facing the global community, many countries are now experiencing severe consequences of climate change such as droughts, floods, extreme weather patterns, etc. In December 2019, a study from NASA and the European Space Agency found that around 3.8 trillion tons of ice had been lost from Greenland\u2019s icesheet between 1992 and 2018 as a result of global warming. I am sure no one can feel the impact of this loss more than our friends in Greenland.\n5. Amidst these difficult times, it is even more important for us to work closely to support multilateral institutions like the Arctic Council, and of course the Arctic Circle Assembly led by President Gr\u00edmsson.\n6. We believe that we can all make a common cause on initiatives of the Arctic Council. To this end, Singapore has partnered with various Arctic States to invest in technology and research in the maritime sector. For example, the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore is participating as a \u201cCore Member\u201d of the Zero-Emission Shipping Mission. This is a coalition of countries led by the Danish Maritime Authority and the Maersk McKinney Moller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping.\n7. Singapore also works closely with Arctic Council\u2019s various working groups. We have regular exchanges through the Emergency Preparedness, Prevention and Response (EPPR) Working group and hosted representatives of the Arctic indigenous peoples to three Singapore Study Visits in 2012, 2014 and 2017. Singapore also worked closely with Arctic Circle Assembly Chairman President Gr\u00edmsson to organise the \u201cSingapore Forum on the Arctic\u201d in November 2015. The objective of this forum is to bring the discussions of the Arctic issues to the Southeast Asian region.\n8. Beyond our existing collaboration, Singapore is keen to step up cooperation with many Arctic States in mitigating climate change given its profound impact on all of us. As a low-lying coastal nation, Singapore is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels.\n9. To mitigate this, Singapore has taken a decisive step to accelerate the decarbonisation of our economy. We aim to achieve net zero carbon emission by around mid-century. We plan to quadruple local solar energy production from 2020 levels by 2025. In addition, we introduced the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia in 2019. This is aimed at reducing emissions, creating green and sustainability projects, and transiting to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy.\n10. In conclusion, given the excellent relations between Singapore and the Arctic States, I look forward to seeing more governmental, academic, and business interactions ahead. We welcome our Arctic friends to visit us to exchange views on how Singapore can better collaborate with the Arctic States. Thank you.\nSpecial Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan delivering a speech during the opening session on \u201cThe View from Asia\u201d.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and former President of the Republic of Iceland and Chairman of the Arctic Circle Assembly \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Iceland Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Greenland Minister for Foreign Affairs, Business and Trade Vivian Motzfeldt.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMeeting between Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan and Faroe Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture Jenis av Rana\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

The Meeting had extensive discussions on recent regional and global developments, including the situation in Myanmar, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and cross-strait developments.\nASEAN noted that no progress has been made on the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus (5PC). The decision by the Myanmar military authorities to execute four opposition activists in the week leading up to the 55th AMM was a grave setback for ASEAN\u2019s efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution and national reconciliation in Myanmar. It also disrespected the efforts of the ASEAN Chair Cambodia and the ASEAN Special Envoy on Myanmar.\nASEAN reiterated the importance of continued implementation of the 5PC. Without any progress on this front, further engagement with the Myanmar military authorities would be of limited value. ASEAN is exploring ways to engage with all stakeholders in Myanmar. Minister Balakrishnan reiterated our call for the release of all political detainees, including President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and for the ASEAN Special Envoy on Myanmar to have access to all stakeholders.\nThe Meeting discussed the negative impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, in particular on energy and food prices. ASEAN reiterated its call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the resumption of peaceful dialogue among all parties concerned. ASEAN hoped that grain exports from Ukraine can resume to pre-conflict levels.\nThe AMM discussed cross-strait developments with concern. Stable US-China relations are vital for regional peace and prosperity. Singapore hopes that the US and China can work out a modus vivendi, exercise self-restraint and refrain from actions that will further escalate tensions.\nMinister Balakrishnan also participated in a joint call on Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen with other ASEAN Foreign Ministers, during which the Prime Minister shared his insights on geopolitical issues.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 AUGUST 2022\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Phnom Penh on 3 August 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nFamily photo at the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Phnom Penh on 3 August 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s joint call on Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen with other ASEAN Foreign Ministers on 3 August 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Singapore strongly condemns this senseless act of violence.\nAs Japan\u2019s longest-serving Prime Minister, Mr Abe had made significant contributions to Japan through his signature reforms, such as Abenomics, which developed Japan\u2019s economy and society, and improved the lives of the ordinary Japanese people.\nI had the privilege of working with Mr Abe for almost a decade. With his support, Singapore-Japan relations grew from strength to strength, with cooperation expanding in many areas such as trade and investments, innovation, infrastructure development, smart cities, and cultural exchanges. For example, the first review of the Japan-Singapore New-Age Economic Partnership Agreement was successfully concluded under Mr Abe\u2019s leadership. Mr Abe\u2019s close ties to Singapore were evident in his special effort to attend the State Funeral of Singapore\u2019s founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 2015 and the Lying in State of former Singapore President Mr S R Nathan in 2016, which Singapore greatly appreciated. Mr Abe will always be remembered as a good friend of Singapore.\nMr Abe was an active international statesman, who deepened Japan\u2019s engagement with regional groupings such as ASEAN and APEC. During Mr Abe\u2019s term in office, Singapore and Japan worked closely together to promote a free, open and inclusive regional architecture, as well as multilateralism and trade liberalisation. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership would not have been successfully concluded without Mr Abe and Japan\u2019s vision and leadership.\nMr Abe\u2019s passing will be felt deeply in Japan, Singapore and around the world. My thoughts are with you and the people of Japan during this period of grief.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Kishida Fumio\nPrime Minister\nJapan"

Singapore is probably the smallest nation here, smaller than Fiji. We are a city-state in Southeast Asia, multiracial, and trade is three times our GDP. We are dependent on a stable world that cooperates on the basis of multilateralism. But we are now facing a perfect storm \u2013 pandemic, war, energy crisis, bifurcated world, superpowers. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a full-frontal assault on the principles of the UN Charter. The UN Charter prohibits the threat, or the use of force, against the territorial sovereignty or political independence of any state, large or small. Whatever justifications we have heard today, they do not justify this full and frontal violation of the pillars of the UN Charter. And this, for a tiny city-state, represents a profoundly inimical development on the security, survival and prosperity of all small states, which likewise would depend on international law. I just want to make four quick points. First, dialogue and diplomacy remain essential, and I am grateful to Indonesia for convening this meeting and including both Russia and Ukraine. And I hope honest-to-goodness conversations will result from this opportunity. Second, we need to recommit to avoiding armed conflict. History shows that the devastating impact of a war on all parties is real. And there are no winners ultimately. In fact, it is the powerless, the weak and vulnerable that bear a disproportionate share of the suffering. Third, we need to update and strengthen the UN and the other international organisations also represented around this table, in order that they remain fit-for-purpose as an effective framework to bridge differences, manage crises and foster cooperation in a real and realistic way.\nThe recent 12th WTO Ministerial Conference is a clear example where with political will, with compromise, we can set aside our differences and achieve a consensus outcome that is acceptable to all and benefits everyone.\nFourth, we must uphold an inclusive, rules-based multilateral system; guard against protectionism; avoid retreating back to an era of the Cold War; and avoid bifurcations \u2013 whether in technology, multilateral finance or trading, or in digital standards.\nColleagues, multilateralism is not perfect, but it is the only game in town. Thank you again for this opportunity to participate today. Thank you, Ibu Retno.\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S REMARKS AT PLENARY SESSION TWO, \u2018ADDRESSING FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY\u2019 AT THE G20 FOREIGN MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING IN BALI ON 8 JULY 2022 Thank you Ibu Retno. Singapore is an absolute food importer. Almost everything we eat, drink and consume has to be imported. Just a couple of quick points. First, stop weaponising food. There was already an incipient food, energy and water crisis building up over the years, but we have this knack of making things worse. Let us do away with all the elaborate excuses or explanations. Let us just let the food flow. The key role for the G20 now is to at least get the grains out of both the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea onto the world markets. The second point is we need to keep our borders open; we need to resist the temptation of protectionism. We need to avoid the political reflex of export. These are siren calls, but ultimately self-defeating at a global level. Third, we need to transform our food systems in order to increase the yields. Without a significant increase in food technology and yields, we will not be able to overcome the shortage. There are some controversial topics like GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). I know that there are some countries that operate on precautionary principle, but we really need to get realistic on how we are going to feed the growing world population. Similarly, we also need a better handle on IUU (Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported) fishing because when we deplete our fish stocks, we are just setting up problems for ourselves. For some of us, we need to depend on aquaculture. We also need to have the technology and to be able to do this sustainably. The fourth point is on the energy transition. In a sense, the current geostrategic crisis which we are facing has also made the development of green energy not just a green issue, not just an issue of resilience, but in fact, one of national security. This is again, another imperative that we need to work together, share the fruits of research and development, facilitate cross border trade of renewable energy and the supply chains that support it. I would also add that for those of you who are capable of safe, civilian nuclear power \u2013 this is also another complement. Otherwise, in the short term, even as we make the energy transition, coal will remain a big portion of baseload production of energy. My appeal to the G20 is stop weaponising food, get food flowing across borders, support research and development, and help us get into a sustainable word where we can feed people and we do not make things worse.\nThank you all very much.\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Indonesia Minister for Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi at the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Chinese State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister of External Affairs of India Dr S Jaishankar\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Catherine Colonna\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Marcelo Ebrard\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation of Spain Jose Manuel Albares Bueno\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022 Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore\nPhoto caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship of Argentina Santiago Cafiero\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Bali, 8 July 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore"

I have lost count (of) how many times you have been in Singapore, how many times we have met in your various incarnations, but you know, you are always welcome in Singapore.\nSingapore and Australia are long standing natural partners, and partners with what I would describe as a huge reservoir of strategic trust. We tend to see the world through similar perspectives, for instance, on the need to maintain an open and inclusive regional order, our mutual belief in the constructive value and importance of free trade and of course, the rule of law. Our relations encompass the whole spectrum of interactions and have in more recent years been anchored especially by the comprehensive strategic partnership. Some of the key elements in that partnership are of course the upgrade of the free trade agreement and the military training facilities that Australia has so graciously provided for Singapore. And just as an aside, in fact, later this year, there will be a resumption of full training, both unilateral and bilateral components, with the Australian Defence Force. Again, another illustration of the deep wells of strategic trust. Looking forward, we have had some good discussions with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong which just recently concluded. There are a couple of areas which we want to explore and take further. The first is the green economy partnership or Green Economy Agreement. This is something which obviously is of crucial importance to Singapore because we are a small, tiny island state, and climate change is an existential threat for us. And I suggested to Minister Wong that we can make this an ambitious, practical, pathfinding agreement. One which will make a difference to our economy, one which will fulfil the climate ambition of our people, one that makes sense to the business sector as well. Our officials have met about 10 times thus far but we have agreed that we will press on the accelerator, and get them to really arrive at a highly ambitious pathfinding agreement, which will make a difference both to Australia and Singapore while also helping us in our further negotiations with other partners on the green economy. We also had reflected on the fact that during the crisis, Australia and Singapore were stalwart partners. And again, the way you behave in a crisis reveals a lot about national character and the levels of trust. I can say with absolute confidence that Australia and Singapore stood by each other in crisis. As we look forward, we believe that there is value in exploring how we can make our supply chains even more resilient for the future. We have agreed to convene a working group among the officials to explore how we can construct supply chains which will withstand the test of future crises, and which will draw on these wells of strategic trust between our two countries. So indeed, there is a lot to celebrate regarding the past. I stand ready to be corrected, but I believe the relations between Singapore and Australia have been an example of bipartisan consensus in Australian politics. On that note again, let me welcome you and look forward to your comments. Min Zhang (ST): Good afternoon I am Min Zhang from Straits Times. My question is for Minister Vivian. You mentioned just now about strengthening supply chains. Australia has long been a reliable source of food and commodities for Southeast Asia and especially for Singapore as well. Could I ask for some elaboration on this plan that you mentioned earlier to strengthen this resilience given the supply chains constraints we are facing and of course, inflationary pressures? Thank you. Minister Balakrishnan: Well, as I illustrated earlier, just cast your mind back to the darkest times of COVID-19, and Australians were trying to get home from Europe \u2013 we maintained our transit facilities, always available and open, even when Singaporeans needed to return from other places. If we ever needed to get consular assistance, or even evacuation from Australia, you (Australia) have been there. If you think about even the delivery of vaccines to Australia, it came via Singapore. Both the Australian Health Minister and I were tracking the transponder on the plane as it made its way to Australia. For food, if you again recall the past when we had disruptions even with pork two decades ago, Australia was there. You look at chicken, Australia is an exporter too. In fact, I suspect we just ate Australian meat upstairs (MFA) just now. Further, when there were essential pharmaceutical supplies again either passing through us or from Australia to us and to the rest of the world, Changi Airport, our port, remained open and available. At each moment, neither government ever panicked, ever sought to requisition supplies or restrict the flow. We just emphasised the sanctity of contract. This is the foundation on which we think we should now be preparing for the next crisis because there will be more, whether it be in energy or food, and we think we can make these arrangements in advance, and that is why our officials will get together and make these contingency plans because we know that we have a reliable partner. I do not want to jump the gun, but I think this is an area which we are working on a very strong foundation. I should also mention energy. Australia intends to be, I believe, a hydrogen hub as well, because you clearly have potential, great potential, for renewable energy and to produce green hydrogen. As Singapore is a bunkering port, if we can look forward to further transformation in maritime and other transport infrastructure, this again is another very fertile area where we can work closely together. So there is much to be done. Maybe you (Minister Wong) would like to add? Minister Wong: The only thing I would add to that is \u2013 to expand on the point I made earlier which Minister Vivian illustrated in his (Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s) answer, which is the economic opportunity of both our economies and peoples of the net zero emissions by 2050 objective. It will transform, and it is already transforming, the global economy, and part of what forward leaning and far-seeing governments need to do is to identify the opportunities in that new global economy which is actually not that far away if you think about this in terms of economic transformation. What are those new economic opportunities \u2013 and we in Australia think we have great opportunities for us \u2013 and I think discussions today demonstrated how there are great opportunities for both our countries to work together. Minister Balakrishnan: So, watch this space. A lot more is going to happen. Clara Lee (CNA): Thank you very much for your remarks, Ministers. I am Clara from Channel NewsAsia. This question is directed to Minister Vivian, I was just wondering with regards to the Green Economy Agreement, do we have \u2013 is there a timeline we can expect or are there any challenges that you foresee you will need to overcome in order to get it running? Minister Balakrishnan: Well, I think we issued a Joint Vision Statement (on the GEA) back in October 2021. As I said earlier, there has been 10 rounds of negotiations. I think both Penny and I are more interested in ambition than in a rushed agreement. As I said, I view this agreement as being a pathfinder, a template, for future agreements. So while we both want to put pressure on our officials, I do not think we want to \u2013 do you (Minister Wong) want to put an absolute deadline on it? Minister Wong: Oh no, we should just put a qualitative standard. Minister Balakrishnan: So I think quality, ambition, is more important than doing things in a hurry. But we will get there. I am confident of this.\nPhoto Caption: Call on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong by Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Lunch hosted by Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan for Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s Joint Press Conference with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s Joint Press Conference with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Call on Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong by Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia Penny Wong on 6 July 2022.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore"

I conveyed the good wishes of President Halimah Yacob of Singapore to His Majesty King Mohammed VI, and I had the honoured privilege of presenting to you just now the invitation from President Halimah Yacob for His Majesty King Mohammed VI to pay a State Visit to Singapore. His Majesty has been to Singapore before \u2013 his last State Visit was in 2005. But we think this is now a very opportune moment for him to honour us again with his presence in Singapore. As Minister Bourita has mentioned just now, we had a very productive, very open (and) sincere conversation. Morocco and Singapore are in different parts of the world. Both of us are gateways to respective areas of the world. Here in North Africa, in fact, beyond North Africa, the entire African continent and including Morocco\u2019s ability to go across the Atlantic to South America (and) North America. On the other hand, the connection through Singapore to Southeast Asia, and to Asia in general. This is a relationship which has in fact been founded on very good diplomatic ties, but I think the economic dimension of it is just waiting to take off, and to take off significantly.\nOf course, we also discussed additional areas. The first area was on climate change. Because Singapore is a small island, we are very concerned with climate change. It is an existential issue for us. Today, we have signed an agreement, an MOU, for collaboration under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows our two countries to voluntarily cooperate to achieve emission targets which are set out in our respective Nationally Determined Contributions. Collective action is needed by all countries if we are to overcome the challenges of climate change. As someone who spent many years on negotiations which led up to (the) Paris (Agreement), this is a meaningful area of collaboration between our countries. So for me, this means something significant.\nThe second additional area we discussed was how Morocco and Singapore will work together to provide technical assistance to Africa. Singapore and Morocco will jointly organise a pilot programme on leadership and governance in October 2022 \u2013 that is just a few months more. This course will be organised in Morocco and for African countries. The signing of the Letter of Intent signals our hope to conclude an MOU on technical cooperation for Africa soon. I want to thank Morocco again for partnering with us. I think this is another area where we can show the fruits of our cooperation.\nI want to make one more reflection on something which has really struck me on my visit down here. That is the fact that Morocco represents the values of tolerance, co-existence and religious harmony. We were discussing just now that in Morocco, you consider this natural. But this wonderful attribute of Morocco is in fact unusual, special and precious. This is a message that Morocco needs to take to the world. That is the other reason why we hope His Majesty will visit us, to come to Southeast Asia and show that wonderful aspect of Moroccan society, history and tradition. When I first arrived in Casablanca, I had an opportunity to visit the majestic Hassan II Mosque. After that, I went to the David Hamelekh Synagogue in Casablanca. I also had discussions with the Senior Advisor to His Majesty Andr\u00e9 Azoulay. I should add (that) I also spoke to the rabbi in Singapore, who tells me his family comes from Morocco many centuries before. The key point he told me was how much they appreciated the leadership of His Majesty, his father, and his grandfather, in particular the way they protected the minorities during the Second World War when in fact, the easiest thing to do would have been to give in to force. Again, I just want to say how much we admire the leadership of His Majesty, and we look forward to hosting him and to hearing his message of peace.\nWe had a discussion on another issue which I know is of importance to Morocco, and that is the Sahara issue. Let me speak from the perspective of Singapore, which is a tiny city-state. Singapore abides strictly, and always, with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and the relevant UN resolutions, including the UN Security Council Resolution 2602, which we discussed just now. This resolution states that the Security Council took note of the Moroccan proposal for autonomy that was presented to the UN Secretary-General on 11 April 2007 and \u2013 this next part is important \u2013 welcome the serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution. I would add that Singapore supports the serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward. Singapore also commends the efforts by the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura. I hope that he will be given access, and I hope that all the relevant parties will speak to him. Peace, prosperity and development is on the horizon. I think this issue has taken far too long to be resolved. It is our hope that you will be able to resolve it and make progress, and bring peace and hope to all the people.\nThank you again for this wonderful opportunity. I will just add that Morocco is a wonderful country, with wonderful people and amazing history. You have much to show to this world. Thank you.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Senior Adviser to King Mohammed VI Andr\u00e9 Azoulay on 4 July 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates Nasser Bourita on 4 July 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan signing an MOU for Collaboration Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement with Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates Nasser Bourita on 4 July 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the joint press conference with Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates Nasser Bourita on 4 July 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the joint press conference with Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates Nasser Bourita on 4 July 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Efforts to conserve the ocean should be data-driven, and multilateral cooperation must remain the foundation of ocean management.\nSingapore is launching three environmental research projects to enhance our understanding of the ocean. These include a research project relating to the sustainable management of marine fish populations, a project to study the use of solar energy to facilitate coral growth, and a Marine Climate Change Science programme. Singapore is spearheading a transition towards environmentally-friendly ship fuel, and will continue to share best practices and technical experiences with countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme.\nThe transcript of the national statement is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n28 JUNE 2022\nNATIONAL STATEMENT DELIVERED BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nDR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT THE UNITED NATIONS OCEAN CONFERENCE IN LISBON,\n28 JUNE 2022\nMr President\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nI first want to thank co-hosts Kenya and Portugal for convening this meeting. This year has added significance as we commemorate the 40th anniversary of (the adoption of) the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nSingapore is a tiny island, maritime city-state. Our history, our people, our economy are inseparable from the ocean. Our survival, our prosperity depends on the oceans. In fact, the same applies to all people, even those from landlocked States. The ocean provides food, jobs and livelihood. It enables global trade, and it plays a vital role in the climate systems and the water cycle, and is an important reservoir of biodiversity.\nThe challenges facing the ocean have increased with each passing year. This Conference\u2019s theme of \u201cScaling up Ocean Action Based on Science and Innovation (for the implementation of Goal 14)\u201d is timely and salient. We, the Member States, need to urgently scale up actions to collectively protect the ocean, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. I wish to make three points.\nFirst, the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean must be conducted under the aegis of international law, in particular UNCLOS, which we believe is the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. Thanks to its drafters\u2019 far-sightedness, the framework provided by UNCLOS is dynamic and highly adaptable in order to respond to emerging issues.\nSecond, our efforts should be based on data and science. This will help us take more effective set of measures to conserve the ocean and to build consensus for global action. For example, the international community is only starting now to appreciate the ocean-climate nexus, in particular, how climate change affects the ocean\u2019s health and how the ocean regulates the climate.\nThird, multilateral cooperation must be the foundation of our efforts. Member States must seize the opportunity that this Conference presents to reaffirm our commitment to placing a rules-based multilateral and coordinated approach at the heart of our management of the oceans.\nOne prominent example of these three points can be found in the ongoing negotiations on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty. The BBNJ treaty will be grounded in UNCLOS and will strengthen multilateral cooperation, conservation and sustainability in the use of our global commons. Singapore is honoured to serve as the President of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference, and we call on all delegations to work towards the conclusion of an ambitious and future-proof BBNJ treaty as soon as possible.\nWhile Singapore is tiny, we are doing our part. I am pleased to announce that Singapore is renewing ten of the voluntary commitments that we had previously submitted at the first UN Oceans Conference and are undertaking nine new ones. Allow me to outline just a few of these.\nWe are launching three environmental research projects to enhance our understanding of the ocean: a research project relating to the sustainable management of marine fish populations, another project to study the use of solar energy to facilitate coral growth, and a Marine Climate Change Science programme.\nOn the shipping front, we are spearheading a transition towards the supply of environmentally-friendly ship fuel, and are actively involved in promoting green financing and building capacity in carbon accounting within the maritime industry. We are also incentivising shipowners to switch to energy efficient technologies and low or zero carbon fuels through the award of the Singapore Registry of Ships Green Notation.\nThe Singapore Cooperation Programme, the SCP for short, which was launched in 1992 to share our development experience and extend technical assistance to fellow developing countries, will be conducting three courses this year on International Law of the Sea, Managing Coastal Biodiversity under Urbanisation Pressures and Environmental Conservation and Sustainability. Over the past 30 years, the SCP has conducted over 50 ocean-related courses for more than 1,000 participants from over 100 countries.\nI look forward to a week of fruitful discussions on how the international community can come together to protect our ocean for current and future generations.\nThank you very much\nPhotos Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s National Statement at the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon on 28 June 2022\nPhotos Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

I thought I would use this opportunity for me to share some perspectives from the view of a tiny city-state.\nMy first point is that in Singapore, we have integrated the entire water cycle by having one single agency under one single Minister in charge of everything to do with water \u2013 water supply, used water reclamation, drainage, flooding, coastal protection and even the state of the oceans and aquaculture all under a single agency. You get policy coherence because everything is internalised within the Ministry. It enables us to have detailed, long-term land use plans. It enables us to have strict environmental protection and sustain investment over the long-term in the necessary infrastructure, and \u2013 one perhaps unpopular point here, but politically necessary \u2013 the right pricing of water. This integrated approach in Singapore allows us to capture, to use, and to reuse almost every single drop available. Rainwater is collected by a network of waterways and drains. Almost every single stream and drain in Singapore flows into a reservoir. If you stop to think about it, that means the cleanliness of every street, every pavement and every channel is essential because ultimately, we drink tap water. We also recycle our used water into high-grade reclaimed water, which we brand NEWater. This helps us buffer against dry spells and boosts our water security. In fact, we channel all our used water to water reclamation plants. So, the first point \u2013 integration.\nThe second point is on the impact of reverse osmosis on the strategic scenario for water in Singapore. In the last decade and a half, this has completely transformed our planning norms. It has enabled us to recycle and to produce more water at an affordable price. But, and there is a very big but \u2013 energy. In Singapore today, it means that 3.5 kilowatt hour (per cubic metre) of electricity is able to generate 1,000 litres of desalinated water. We are working on projects to bring that number down to about 2.0 kilowatt hours (per cubic metre) to produce 1,000 litres of water. Another key innovation is, even if you replace your strategic dependence on water with a strategic dependence on energy, you then need to deal with energy resilience and security. We have now deployed floating solar panels on our reservoirs, and you understand that we need to do that because we are short of land. This enables us to generate green energy for all our water needs and operate within our water ecosystem. In fact, with the completion of the latest 60 megawatt-peak (MWp) floating solar PV system, Singapore is one of the few countries to have a 100% fully green waterworks system. It is not just about being green. But you can imagine that there are security and resilience implications from being able to provide all the energy that your water system needs.\nMy third point is to get economics right. I said this will be politically sensitive and unpopular, but without the right pricing of water, you will not get sensible and rational resource allocation, and you will not incentivise the conservation of scarce water resources. In Singapore, we peg our water price to the long-run marginal cost of producing the next available drop. In Singapore's case, what that means is our price reflects both the capital expenditure and the operating expenditure of desalinated water \u2013 that is, the next available drop for Singapore. The politicians in this audience should immediately ask me, if you are charging the long-run marginal cost, what do you do about less well-off families? The answer is, we credit cash into the utility accounts of all these families so that despite the long-run marginal price tag, nobody goes thirsty because of inability to pay for water. This long-term approach to pricing also ensures that there is long-term guarantee for the private sector partners who invest in infrastructure to know that we are good for our money. The money is available, and our credit worthiness stands. This is a matter of national security for Singapore. In fact, what this has enabled us to do is to convert a strategic vulnerability into a strategic opportunity. Today, Singapore is a leading global hub, home to a vibrant and thriving ecosystem with more than 200 water companies and 25 water research centres spanning the entire water value chain.\nMy fourth point is on climate change, which is an existential threat to a low-lying island city-state like Singapore. There is no question for us, observing our shores, that the sea levels are rising. Between 1970 to 2019, in the span of about 50 years, sea levels around Singapore have risen by about 14 centimetres. You may not think 14 centimetres is that significant, but if you pay attention to what the IPCC reports are predicting, that number could accelerate significantly, especially in the second half of the century. We pay great attention to climate adaptation. Despite all our efforts \u2013 and I spent many years as one of the ministerial negotiators for the Paris Agreement \u2013 we have a gnawing fear that our plans for global mitigation may not come true. If that happens, we are vulnerable. We are putting together a comprehensive long-term plan to protect our coastlines from sea levels. We hope in this session to learn from the experiences of other countries who are facing similar existential threats. We are conducting site-specific studies across our coastline of more than 300 kilometres to develop feasible coastal protection solutions, which include building conventional coastal protection measures such as tidal gates and storm surge barriers and including exploring some hybrid solutions which combine nature-based elements, such as mangroves and seagrasses.\nAs we stand now at the midpoint of the Water Action Decade, the international community needs to strengthen our collaboration to overcome these strategic, long-term and existential water challenges. I look forward to participating in this discussion and picking up ideas from you. All our countries have a unique set of challenges and we need to keep an open mind and have the political will and resources to come up with the solutions \u2013 not only to formulate them, but to implement them. Thank you all very much.\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering opening remarks at the High-Level Symposium on Water Ministerial Roundtable at the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon, 27 June 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan co-chairing the High-Level Symposium on Water Ministerial Roundtable at the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon, 27 June 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

The Memorial is a place of remembrance to honour the victims of 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\nPrime Minister Lee received an official welcome at the Urugwiro Village (which is the Office of the President) and proceeded to have a bilateral meeting with President Paul Kagame. Prime Minister Lee reaffirmed the warm ties and good cooperation between Singapore and Rwanda. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, both countries have continued to engage in areas such as digital economy, FinTech, and judicial cooperation. Both leaders discussed ways that Singapore and Rwanda can further deepen cooperation. They also exchanged views on regional and global developments.\nTo mark the 30th year of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and to welcome Africa\u2019s continued participation in SCP courses, Prime Minister Lee announced the Singapore \u2013 Africa Partnership Package (SAPP). The SAPP aims to share Singapore\u2019s development experience and best practices in areas relevant to Africa\u2019s needs and priorities. The SAPP will see Singapore partner African officials through customised courses, priority placement in relevant SCP courses, and postgraduate scholarships in Singapore universities.\nFollowing the meeting, President Kagame and Prime Minister Lee held a Joint Press Conference. PM Lee said that although Singapore and Rwanda are on different continents, both are small countries with limited resources and are keen to work with others to secure peace, progress, and prosperity for their peoples. On the SAPP, Singapore looks forward to Rwanda\u2019s and Africa\u2019s participation.\nAfter the press conference, Prime Minister Lee was hosted to lunch by President Kagame.\nThe transcript of Prime Minister Lee\u2019s remarks at the Joint Press Conference is below.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n27 JUNE 2022\nTRANSCRIPT OF OPENING REMARKS BY\nPRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG AT JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH\nRWANDAN PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME ON MONDAY, 27 JUNE 2022\nThank you President Kagame for hosting me and my delegation.\nI am very happy to be here in Rwanda. Last week, I attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). I congratulate President Kagame for hosting a successful CHOGM. Rwanda has also done an excellent job organising this major in-person high-level international event despite the challenges of COVID-19.\nSingapore\u2019s Relations with Africa\nThis is my first official visit to an African country. It has been a very meaningful one. I am very glad that CHOGM has created the opportunity for me to meet my counterparts in Africa face-to-face, to exchange views and perspectives with each other. I am also deeply appreciative that I have had the chance to learn more about Rwanda, and to further our friendship and bilateral cooperation.\nSingapore may be geographically far away, but we have many friends in Africa. Singapore\u2019s founding Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, first visited Africa more than 50 years ago. Even now, some of the African leaders I met at CHOGM still recall his visit to their countries. And I am grateful for this reservoir of goodwill in Africa towards Singapore.\nOver the last decade, Singapore\u2019s interactions with Africa have grown. Our Government-to-Government cooperation has increased, with regular visits between our officials and leaders. More Singaporeans are coming to work here in Africa. Yesterday I hosted tea for some Singaporeans living and working here in Rwanda. Many of them were young people, seeking challenges and opportunities. They have seen the promise in this young society, and they are pursuing their projects here with passion. Our companies are also venturing into Africa. It is a new market to them, but the economic opportunities are growing as the continent opens up to digitalisation, regional integration, and global trade.\nThere are many bright spots in Africa, and Rwanda is one of the brightest. Singapore looks forward to deepening our cooperation, and increasing trade and investment between Singapore and Rwanda.\nPresident Kagame has visited Singapore a few times. I am very glad to reciprocate by visiting this beautiful and impressive country. Rwanda is a rapidly developing, innovative, forward-looking and building a nation. I congratulate President Kagame for his leadership in stewarding Rwanda\u2019s development over the years.\nBilateral Relations\nIn our meeting, President Kagame and I reaffirmed the excellent state of Singapore-Rwanda relations, and discussed areas for further collaboration. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, our two countries continue to cooperate actively. Our people-to-people ties have remained strong. Leaders and officials have kept up the tempo of engagements. Both the President and I are committed to advancing our bilateral partnership. We have established good collaboration, including making new initiatives on the digital economy, FinTech, and even judicial cooperation.\nMultilateral Cooperation\nOn the multilateral front, Rwanda and Singapore also have strong collaboration, including at the UN. Both are members of the Forum of Small States (FoSS). We work closely together to advance the interests of small states and strengthen the multilateral system.\nSingapore-Africa Partnership Package\nSingapore is encouraging our people and businesses to venture into new markets in Africa.\nWe are also happy to share our experience in economic develop\u00adment, human resource development and capacity building with others. That is why we established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992. SCP programmes have been well received by officials of African countries. Over 12,000 African officials, including many from Rwanda, have attended SCP courses in Singapore to date.\nOn this 30th anniversary of the SCP, I am happy to announce a three-year Singapore-Africa Partnership Package. We will customise courses in priority areas for Africa. These will cover emerging issues such as on Climate Change and Sustainability, and Digitalisation and Smart Cities. We will provide priority placement for African officials in our SCP courses. And we will also offer postgraduate scholarships for senior African officials in Singapore universities.\nI am particularly glad to be able to announce the launch of this technical cooperation package in Rwanda. Rwandan officials have actively participated in SCP courses over the years. And we look forward to Rwanda\u2019s and Africa\u2019s continued participation in the SCP.\nClosing\nAlthough we are on different continents, our two countries have much in common. Both are small countries, with limited resources. Both place importance on international cooperation to improve our societies and our peoples\u2019 lives. Both seek to work with other small countries to secure peace, progress, and prosperity for our peoples in a dangerous world.\nI therefore look forward to working closely with President Kagame to ensure that the relationship between our two countries continues to grow from strength to strength.\nI would like to offer early congratulations to Rwanda for 28th Liberation Day which is on 4th July and to thank President Kagame for his excellent hospitality to me and my delegation."

Countries should work together to ensure that international trade remains smooth, predictable, open and reliable, and chart an inclusive post-COVID-19 recovery.\nMinister Balakrishnan highlighted four key lessons to strengthen countries\u2019 ability to tackle global challenges. First, COVID-19 underscored the importance of ensuring reliable supply chains. Second, countries should build on the momentum of digitalisation while avoiding a widening digital gap. Third, resilience, trust and social capital will enable societies to weather future crises. Fourth, we need to make multilateralism more responsive, effective, inclusive, and networked. He encouraged greater collaboration among international and regional organisations, including the Commonwealth.\nThe transcript of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s intervention is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n23 JUNE 2022\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S\nINTERVENTION ON POST-COVID-19 RECOVERY\nAT THE COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTERS MEETING,\nKIGALI, RWANDA 23 JUNE 2022\nThank you Brother Vincent (Biruta) for so ably chairing this meeting.\nIt is significant that we are here in Rwanda, because Rwanda represents hope. There is always light, even after disasters strike. My colleagues \u2013 democracy is a tool to generate good governance. The outcome of good governance should be peace, prosperity and progress for our citizens. But the question is whether we are making progress as a world. We are confronted \u2013 if you just think about the last two years \u2013 by plague, war, and famine, which should remind us of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It is too early to say what the final outcome will be. But it is not too early to draw some lessons from the last two years, so let me touch on a few of them.\nFirst, COVID-19 underscored the importance of ensuring reliable supply chains for all of us. We saw how the shock of COVID-19 fuelled an initial wave of nativism and outright protectionism, with many countries acting unilaterally to protect their own short-term interests. This led to massive supply chain disruptions and consequences for most of us. For Singapore, a tiny city-state in the heart of Southeast Asia, we were determined to maintain an open flow of goods, people and services. We know that a stable and resilient supply chain is crucial for ensuring the continued flow of essential goods \u2013 food and medical supplies, which are all necessary to sustain life in a pandemic, or indeed, in a war. This is a lesson which remains relevant even now.\nWe are not completely out of the woods, and just when we thought things were getting better, we were confronted by the impact of the war in Ukraine, launched by Russia, which has had enormous impact on food, energy prices and supplies. Again, I want to make the point that we must resist the temptation to turn inwards. Autarky is not viable, especially for small states. Instead, we need to work together to ensure that international trade remains smooth, predictable, open and reliable.\nMy second lesson is that digitalisation is a force that is here to stay. COVID-19 accelerated the pace of digitalisation, and if you think about how we came to rely on technology \u2013 to meet, to engage, to educate, to organise ourselves \u2013 it was a lesson. But it is also a reminder that digital technology is not an unalloyed good. If it is harnessed well, it has been a key source for growth. But if we do not, it could also be a source for greater abrasion, dissension, tension and inequality. We do need to improve efficiencies, for instance, in digital trade, finance solutions and facilitating trade flows. We need to create new solutions, new financial products enabled by FinTech, including especially for micro-businesses. We need to build on the momentum of digitalisation as a key driver of our post COVID-19 growth. But do not forget the widening digital gap. We need to learn from our earlier experience to blunt these excesses early. We need to make sure that no one is left behind. There is much to be done to enhance digital inclusion, especially digital education. We need to improve the digital skills and literacy of all our people, not just the elite in our societies. This means pervasive, universal education and training in digital skills.\nSecond, all governments need to invest in infrastructure for universal and affordable internet connectivity. Third, to expand access to data and digital public goods. That is why digital inclusion is a top priority for Singapore. In February 2021, we launched a \u2018Digital for Life\u2019 national movement to build a digitally inclusive society that would galvanise all our community efforts to help all citizens access the opportunities for embracing digital learning.\nThe third lesson is the importance of resilience, trust, and social capital. Pandemics have their share of the \u2018fog of war\u2019 because there are many unknowns at the initial stage. Add to them the natural sense of panic, the restrictions that our people had to endure with lockdowns and the fact that we were really feeling our way forward with each turn and twist of the pandemic, and the onset of misinformation against both public health and vaccination coming through social media. There is now clear evidence, backed by data, that the societies with the best outcomes from COVID-19 were not necessarily those who were wealthier, but in fact, the best outcomes occurred in societies with stronger social capital, and in particular, trust. Trust between fellow citizens and trust in their socio-political institutions. This intangible factor \u2013 trust \u2013 fundamentally determines the resilience and cohesion of our societies against shocks, and will become even more crucial as we weather complex and unprecedented challenges ahead.\nLastly, I need to make a plug for multilateralism. It has to be a form of multilateralism that is updated, responsive, more effective, more inclusive, and more networked, and represents the interests of all of us at the Commonwealth. We must commit to strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 I am glad we gave Dr Tedros the chance to start this morning\u2019s session \u2013 and to commit to investing in global health architecture. We do need a more effective global surveillance system for new viruses and pathogens. My friends, let me say as a doctor \u2013 there will be new pandemics in our lifetimes. We are beset by global challenges. Apart from pandemics, there is the threat of climate change, famine, food insecurity, threats in cyberspace \u2013 just to name a few. Given the multi-faceted nature of these crises, which will follow and reinforce each other, we do need to encourage urgently, greater collaboration amongst all international and regional organisations, including especially, the Commonwealth. By definition, because of our diverse membership, there is much more that the Commonwealth can and should do to contribute to inclusive solutions that take into account the interests, especially of small, developing nations. There is also ample scope for cooperation in capacity building. On this front, I just want to add that Singapore has been sharing our development experience through the Singapore Cooperation Programme since 1992. This flagship programme, which now marks its 30th anniversary, has received more than 137,000 foreign government officials over these three decades \u2013 including 30,000 officials in the Commonwealth states. We will update these programmes so they remain relevant for the priorities of our fellow developing countries. There will be a stronger focus on sustainable development and digital transformation. We welcome participation from all members of the Commonwealth and other fellow developing and developed countries.\nExcellencies, the road to recovery from famine, war and pestilence will not be straightforward, but it will be better if we walk along together. Thank you very much.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering an intervention on post-COVID-19 recovery at the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Kigali on 23 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nForeign Ministers\u2019 Family Photo at the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Kigali on 23 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Over these thousands (of) years, the cultural, linguistic, religious, commercial, and people-to-people ties have bound us together. Even our religions \u2013 Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam either originated from, or vetted through India into Southeast Asia. The Indian classics, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata, have left deep imprints on our culture, festivals, and in our stage productions in Southeast Asia. Even names like Retno and Balakrishnan are obviously originated from India. I daresay that even Pornpimol have Sanskritic origins. So, my first point \u2013 this is not something new. Both India and many of us in Southeast Asia were colonies and we probably lost about at least two centuries. Part of the reason why we ended up being colonised was because we missed the last Industrial Revolution, which began in the UK and Europe. They were able to parlay advanced insights and technology and economic power into real power, and therefore reached out and used our regions for resources, spices, markets and the rest of it. We are clearly in a post-colonial phase, and in the last seventy to eighty years, particularly for those of us who avoided being on the wrong side of the Iron or Bamboo Curtain, and who advanced or owned productive capacity of our people and connected ourselves to global markets, in fact saw unprecedented progress, peace, and prosperity. If you do not believe me, just look at the figures today: India and ASEAN have two billion people \u2013 one quarter of the world (and with) a combined GDP of almost of USD 6 trillion.\n3 It is not just the static snapshot, but the fact that the potential for growth in GDP, for both India and ASEAN, can double and quadruple in the next two decades. At that level of potential, we will be a vibrant, essential pillar of the world. On the global strategic stage, we have transited from a unipolar moment \u2013 we are going past the bipolar world \u2013 and are emerging into a multipolar world. In that multipolar world, India will be a major tent pole, and so will, I hope, Southeast Asia. The question then is what could possibly derail our fulfilment of that potential? I would focus on three areas.\n4 The first is that if we are able to maintain a rules-based, international order, and rules, not just written and codified and fossilised by the Western world, but one that recognises the diversity and wisdom of the ages from Asia, and makes the necessary adjustments to the post-World War II international institutions like the United Nations \u2013 I know India has an interest in the Security Council \u2013 the Bretton Woods Institutions, the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank; the Generalised Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is now the WTO (World Trade Organization). If we can make these institutions updated and fit for purpose and to adapt to the potential and diversity of Asia, this will be a big plus for us.\n5 Another point on the rules-based international order has been highlighted by the invasion of Ukraine. If we continue to go back to a pre-World War means of engaging other countries, and if we continue to believe that might is right, and that big countries get to redraw boundaries, citing historical errors and crazy decisions, then all bets are off. That is why Singapore and ASEAN have taken a strong position against this invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is right, and over the weekend when he addressed the Shangri-La Dialogue, he said that the battles for the rules are being fought on the battlefields of Ukraine. My point here is not to get into the details of Ukraine versus Russia, but that we do need a universally accepted rules-based world order in which all of us have a say, all of us big or small, wealthy or not so wealthy are equal, and that those superpowers will feel, and will assess that it is in their own enlightened self-interest to restrain themselves and act in accordance with international law.\n6 The second pre-requisite for us to fulfil our potential is in trade and investments. For Singapore, certainly the last 57 years, one key propellant for our progress has been the fact that we were able to build trade relations across the world and attract investments from all over the world in order to enhance our productive capacity. Today if you look at trade between \u2013 let me just cite Singapore and India, for example, even during the last two-and-a-half years of COVID-19, our trade with India in fact increased by 35 per cent over one year (2020 to 2021). If you look in terms of FDI into India, I always find it amazing that 30 per cent of FDI into India has come through Singapore. Can you imagine when India is fully connected to the entire Southeast Asia, in the same way that we have made a start between Singapore and India? Can you imagine the trade flows, the investment flows, the investment in infrastructure and connectivity? Can you imagine where this will lead to? The point is that trade and investment is strategy in our part of the world. India is not only a giant. If you look in terms of the modern economy \u2013 if I were to ask you, who is likely to be the pharmacy of the world? Who is likely to be the breadbasket of the world? After all, India is already the world\u2019s largest exporter of rice, and rice has a sacred meaning in Southeast Asia. But beyond rice, just examine India\u2019s ability to export agricultural products. If you ask yourself, which giant is likely to be the capital of digital services of the world? You know the answer to my three rhetorical questions are: India, India, India. And now if you link that with Southeast Asia, which has a population half that of India, but whose GDP currently is neck-and-neck with India, and if both of us can double or quadruple our GDP over the next two decades, the sky is the limit. So, I am making the argument, Jaishankar, for greater economic integration between India and Southeast Asia.\n7 My final point is on new technologies. We all know about digitalisation. We know that artificial intelligence is undergoing a revolution. We know that there are whole new professions being created. I think just 10 years ago, if your son came to you and said he wanted to become a data analyst, you would scratch your head and say, \u201cwhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d. If he said he wanted to be a cybersecurity expert, you would say, \u201cwell, possibly\u201d. But my point is the digital revolution is in fact, a complete revamp of the means of production and of wealth generation for the future. This is another area which India has a natural lead, and if we can complement India\u2019s capability and the latent, nascent abilities and markets in Southeast Asia, then we can remake not just the next two decades, but, I hope, at least the next half century and beyond.\n8 Let me conclude by saying, again, that the relationship between India and Southeast Asia is not something new. It has gone on for millennia. It was interrupted because we missed the last Industrial Revolution. But we are not going to miss the next Industrial Revolution. So long as we keep a peaceful and stable world based on international law, so long as we open the arterial connections between India and Southeast Asia, and as long as we train our young peoples to harness the opportunities that the digital revolution provides us, we have a great future ahead of us.\n9 Thank you all very much.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, 17 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Minister of Railways, Communications and Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw, 17 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s remarks at the Ministerial Session of the Delhi Dialogue XII, 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan engaging young Indian parliamentarians over a tea reception hosted by Bharatiya Janata Party President JP Nadda, 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Thank you on behalf of all my colleagues from ASEAN for your warm, generous hospitality.\nThe weather is warm, but more so the friendships are warm. We meet today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of ASEAN-India Dialogue Relations, and as you have just reminded us, a decade of Strategic Partnership between ASEAN and India.\nTo be frank, the last two and half years have perhaps been the most challenging for all of us. I am referring, of course, to the public health and economic impact of COVID-19.\nTwo sub-points on that. First, ASEAN and India mutually supported one other. I think each of us can recall episodes when India has stood up to help us, and we, in our own small ways, have also been able to reciprocate.\nThe second thing is that I am confident that ASEAN and India can emerge stronger from COVID-19.\nThe world has also changed rapidly in the last few months. By that I am referring to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which in our view has upended the international system of rules, norms, and international law, which we all depend on and operate on the basis of.\nThe sharpening superpower rivalry between the US and China has direct implications for all of us in Asia. These developments, if left unchecked, can threaten the old system of peace and stability, which we have been dependent on for the basis of our growth, development, and prosperity over many decades.\nAs such, I believe the convening of this Special ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting is timely and is a good opportunity for us to take stock of our comprehensive relations, to enhance the links between the two regions, and to build resilience to tackle ongoing and future challenges.\nThank you once again, Co-Chair, for your generosity and hospitality.\nASEAN Foreign Ministers\u2019 family photo at the Special ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in New Delhi, 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nIndian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar delivering opening remarks at the Special ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in New Delhi on 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering opening remarks at the Special ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in New Delhi on 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar on 15 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the Joint Call on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by ASEAN Foreign Ministers and ASEAN Secretary-General on 16 June 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of External Affairs, India"

        "content": "QUESTION\nMs Sylvia LimTo ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can elaborate on the considerations that led to Singapore recording an abstention on the United Nations General Assembly vote on 7 April 2022 concerning the suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the United Nations Human Rights Council.\nREPLY\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has undermined the global order. It subverts the basic rules and norms for how all countries, big or small, interact with one another. This flagrant violation of the United Nations (UN) Charter is dangerous for all countries, but especially for small states like Singapore.\nOur very existence as a sovereign state, with territorial integrity and independence to chart our own destiny, will be threatened if the international rule of law can be abandoned or obstructed so cavalierly. A UN Security Council Resolution to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had failed to pass because of a Russian veto. The dangerous precedent that \u2018might makes right\u2019 is not a theoretical but an existential issue for a small state like Singapore.\nThat is why Singapore has taken a strong stand to condemn the invasion and imposed targeted sanctions on Russia. We co-sponsored and voted in support of two UN General Assembly Resolutions on the \u201cAggression against Ukraine\u201d, and the \u201cHumanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine\u201d. We also co-sponsored a UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution on the \u201cSituation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression\u201d, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority on 4 March 2022.\nMs Sylvia Lim has asked why we abstained at the subsequent UN General Assembly vote on 7 April 2022 concerning the suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the HRC.\nWe abstained because of the need to comply with due process at the UN. A key outcome of the HRC Resolution that Singapore co-sponsored was to establish an Independent International Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine. On 30 March 2022, the President of the HRC appointed three experts from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia and Norway to serve on the Commission initially for a year. Headed by the international jurist from Norway, the Commission will conduct investigations and make recommendations, in particular, on accountability measures. The Commission will report its initial findings to the HRC and UN General Assembly at their 51st and 77th Sessions respectively beginning in September 2022. Singapore supports the Commission, and we expect accountability for any gross and systematic human rights violations committed during the war in Ukraine.\nWe would have preferred for a decision on the Russian Federation\u2019s membership of the HRC to be made after the Commission reports its findings. Procedurally, this would set the proper precedent in terms of independent fact-gathering and support for the findings of a UN HRC-mandated Commission. This is consistent with Singapore\u2019s longstanding support for the rules-based multilateral system and the UN, and the due application of its mechanisms and procedures. Our abstention was thus a principled one. It is consistent with our position throughout this crisis not to take sides, but to take a stand based on principles, international law and the UN Charter.\nWe are very concerned about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. We are especially disturbed and distressed by media reports of indiscriminate destruction of civilian infrastructure, the killing of civilians especially children and the discovery of mass graves in some cities of Ukraine. We call on all parties, including the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian authorities, to fully cooperate with the independent UN HRC Commission and to allow full and unhindered access for it to conduct its work. The unhindered work of this Commission is crucial for the credibility and effectiveness of the HRC and the UN.\nSingapore fully supports the work of the UN and its agencies to provide humanitarian support and to find a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was in New York in March 2022 where he met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and received an update on the situation in Ukraine. He expressed our support for the work of the UN and the Secretary-General. We also welcome the recent visits to Moscow and to Kyiv by the Secretary-General. We believe that the good offices of the Secretary-General will be crucial in this crisis, especially in facilitating the creation of humanitarian corridors and in delivering much needed assistance to the people of Ukraine.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n9 MAY 2022"

The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected. Singapore takes any violation of these core principles seriously, as they are fundamental to the survival of Singapore, a small state.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine contravenes the UN Charter and is a clear and gross violation of international law. We cannot accept the Russian government\u2019s violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state. For a small state like Singapore, this is not a theoretical principle, but a dangerous precedent. This is why Singapore has strongly condemned Russia\u2019s unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\nSince the UNSC resolution to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine failed to pass due to Russia\u2019s veto, and given the unprecedented gravity of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, Singapore decided that we will impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia. Many other countries around the world have joined in the international sanctions.\nAs announced on 5 March 2022, our sanctions and restrictions aim to constrain Russia\u2019s capacity to conduct war against Ukraine and undermine its sovereignty. We have imposed export controls on items that can be directly used as weapons to inflict harm on or to subjugate the Ukrainians, as well as items that can contribute to offensive cyber operations. In particular, this includes a ban on the transfer to Russia of all items in the Military Goods List, and all items in the \u201cElectronics\u201d, \u201cComputers\u201d, and \u201cTelecommunications and Information Security\u201d categories of the Dual-Use Goods List in the Strategic Goods (Control) Order 2021.\nIn addition, we have imposed financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks and activities in Russia, and fundraising activities benefitting the Russian government. These measures apply to all financial institutions in Singapore, including banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets intermediaries, securities exchanges and payment service providers. Specifically, financial institutions in Singapore are prohibited from:\nThe full scope of the sanctions imposed by Singapore on Russia is set out in MFA\u2019s Press Statement of 5 March 2022 and the enclosed factsheets, as well as MAS Notices SNR-N01 and SNR-N02, issued by MAS to all financial institutions in Singapore on 14 March 2022, which have been published on MAS\u2019 website.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n9 MAY 2022"

The Most Honourable Order of the Crown of Johor and its Statutes and Regulations were instituted based on the English Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. London Royal Jeweller J. W. Benson was appointed to make the insignias of the order. The Order of the Crown of Johor consists of the Sovereign and three designated classes of membership. The First Class, Grand Commander, is styled as Dato\u2019 Sri Paduka Mahkota Johor (SPMJ) and the Second Class, Commander, as Dato\u2019 Paduka Mahkota Johor (DPMJ). Both classes carry the honorific title \u201cDato\u2019\u201d. The Third Class, Companion (Setia) does not carry any title. Ordinary Members of the Order are invited from among Malays professing the religion of Islam and subjects of the Ruler and who have exhibited loyalty, virtues, and talents and have rendered invaluable service to the Sultan and State. Malays from other States, and other races whether subjects of the Ruler or otherwise and who meet the criteria may be invited as Honorary Members. Being a staunch Muslim, Abu Bakar took into consideration the teachings, philosophies, beliefs and rituals of Islam in designing the insignia of the Order. The collar of the First Class of the Order in gilt and red enamel is made up of links in the form of crescent and stars, bows and the cyphers in Arabic of Prophet Mohammad's Principal Disciples and Companions Abu Bakar, Othman, Omar and Ali. The back link is the design of a crown. The front device supported by two golden tigers is the name of the Prophet in Arabic surmounted by a crown and flanked by the Mace of Religion on the right and the Mace of the Universe on the left, with a blue scroll below bearing the motto of the Order in Arabic \u201cKepada Allah Berserah\u201d (Unto Allah Resigned). The breast star 90mm in diameter is made of silver designed with five flame-like rays with gold crescents and stars between the rays. The crescent and star is the symbol of Islam, the official religion of the State of Johor. Five is the number of the Pillars of Islam, and the number of daily obligatory prayers to be observed. The centre of the breast star is encircled by a blue garter bearing the motto of the Order and consists of a white field with a crown, the name of the Prophet in Arabic and the crescent and star in the centre. An 86mm wide silk sash in yellow with a broad blue centre stripe, and a sash badge 58mm in diameter of similar design as the breast star completes the Order. The crown denotes Abu Bakar as Sovereign and Chief of the Order, blue the colour of the sovereign, white signifies purity and subservience to Allah, yellow the traditional colour of Malay royalty, red and the image of tigers reflects courage and bravery. The Order was instituted on 31 July 1886 following the coronation of Sultan Abu Bakar. Among the first recipients were Dato\u2019 Jaafar Mohamad, the first Menteri Besar of Johor, and members of his cabinet Dato\u2019 Mohamad Salleh bin Perang (Dato\u2019 Bentara Luar), Dato\u2019 Mohamad Ibrahim Abdullah Munshi (Dato\u2019 Bentara Dalam) and Dato\u2019 Sri Amar Diraja Abdul Rahman Andak (the first State Secretary of Johor).

        "content": "Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan spoke at a high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the adoption of UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This meeting was convened by the President of the 76th Session of the UNGA (PGA) His Excellency Abdulla Shahid.\nThe meeting underscored the critical importance of UNCLOS which provides a universal legal framework on the governance of the oceans. When UNCLOS was adopted forty years ago, the international community committed itself to the rule of law in the oceans. The institutions created by UNCLOS have adapted to new challenges and made critical contributions to global peace and security. UNCLOS has assumed greater relevance given challenges such as the exponential growth of maritime shipping and the impact of climate change on the oceans.\nIn his remarks, Minister Balakrishnan emphasised that UNCLOS is especially crucial for Singapore as a small island state whose history, people and economy are intricately intertwined with the seas. Singapore is proud to have contributed to the adoption of UNCLOS in 1982 as Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh served as President of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea. At PGA Shahid\u2019s invitation, Ambassador Koh delivered a keynote address on the significance of UNCLOS.\nThe transcripts of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s joint statement and national statement, and Ambassador Koh\u2019s keynote address are appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n30 APRIL 2022\nTRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN,\nON BEHALF OF DENMARK, GRENADA, KENYA, PORTUGAL AND SINGAPORE, AT THE HIGH-LEVEL COMMEMORATIVE MEETING OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO MARK THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, 29 APRIL 2022\nMr President, Excellencies, friends and colleagues,\nI have the honour of delivering this statement on behalf of Denmark, Grenada, Kenya, Portugal and Singapore. We are the delegations that requested the convening of this meeting to mark the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS the constitution for the oceans.\nWe thank the President of the General Assembly for agreeing to convene this meeting, which commemorates and recognises a pivotal moment for multilateralism and the rule of law in ocean governance. UNCLOS is one of the United Nations\u2019s greatest contributions to the codification and the progressive development of international law. Its adoption by the Third UN (United Nations) Conference on the Law of the Sea affirmed the power of multilateralism in addressing complex issues of the global commons. It also constituted a significant step towards the establishment of a new legal order for the oceans, which was ultimately achieved with UNCLOS\u2019s entry into force in 1994.\nOur delegations would like to highlight three points on this auspicious occasion.\nFirst, we remember, celebrate and honour those who contributed to the conclusion of UNCLOS. The present generation of diplomats and international lawyers should draw inspiration from the leading figures and key participants at the Third Conference. UNCLOS is the legacy of their hard work, their commitment to cooperation and consensus-building, and willingness to promote global interests alongside individual national interests.\nSecond, we reaffirm our commitment to UNCLOS as providing the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. It provides a comprehensive set of rules for the establishment of maritime entitlements and the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. It is fundamental for upholding the right of all States to freedom of navigation and overflight, to maintaining open trade routes, sea lines of communication and the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. We call on all States to fully and effectively implement our obligations under UNCLOS, bearing in mind that it was adopted as a package and (that) there should therefore be no selectivity in its application. We also call on non-Party States to become parties to UNCLOS.\nThird, urgent multilateral action within the framework provided by UNCLOS is needed to ensure the health of our oceans. The implementation of SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) 14, underpinned by UNCLOS, is crucial in this regard. We look forward to the UN Ocean Conference, co-hosted by Kenya and Portugal in June and the fifth session of the BBNJ (Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction) Intergovernmental Conference in August. We urge the international community to seize the opportunities presented by these and other multilateral meetings this year to take concrete steps in support of the conservation and the sustainability of our oceans.\nUNCLOS has stood the test of time. For decades, it has contributed to global peace, security and economic development. Its rules, whilst firm, have sufficient flexibility and scope for new and emerging issues and challenges relating to the oceans to be addressed. Our delegations are confident that the importance of UNCLOS and its contributions will only continue to increase in the decades to come.\nTRANSCRIPT OF NATIONAL STATEMENT BY\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\nAT THE HIGH-LEVEL COMMEMORATIVE MEETING OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO MARK THE\nTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, 29 APRIL 2022\nMr President, I will now take the opportunity to speak in Singapore\u2019s national capacity.\nSingapore is a tiny island-State whose history, people and economy are intricately intertwined with the seas. We are thus proud to have been able to contribute to the formation of UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), most notably when Ambassador Tommy Koh served as President of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea from 1981 until its conclusion.\nUNCLOS was envisioned and developed at a time when many coastal States were making increasingly extensive claims to unilaterally expand their jurisdiction and their rights to exploit the ocean\u2019s resources. UNCLOS brought order and predictability to the governance of our oceans. It has provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together, be they coastal, landlocked, geographically disadvantaged, archipelagic, or island States like us. The institutions created by UNCLOS have adapted to new challenges and made critical contributions to the rule of law in the oceans.\nUNCLOS must play an even more crucial role today. Maritime shipping has grown exponentially as our economies become increasingly inter-connected. Total seaborne trade has risen nearly threefold since 1981. UNCLOS is especially crucial for Singapore, given that our overall trade is more than three times our GDP, and much of our trade is carried over the seas. Nearly 40% of the world\u2019s population now live within 100 kilometres of the coast. Climate change has also brought new issues to the fore, such as degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification.\nSingapore will continue to support multilateral efforts to address these issues. For example, in our capacity as President of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference. Despite being extremely biodiverse, only 1% of the high seas are currently regulated. The BBNJ treaty will significantly contribute to the conservation and the sustainable use of our global commons. We should conclude negotiations on an ambitious and future-proof treaty as soon as possible.\nSingapore is also actively participating in the negotiations for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, or COC, for short. We are committed to negotiating an effective and substantive COC that is in accordance with international law, in particular UNCLOS, and that also safeguards the rights and interests of all parties in the South China Sea.\nWith the adoption of UNCLOS 40 years ago, the global community decisively committed itself to the rule of law in the oceans. Singapore urges all countries to reaffirm their commitment to UNCLOS. We also urge all remaining non-Party States to accede to and/or ratify UNCLOS as soon as possible. We look forward to the next 40 years, hopefully, of peace, justice and progress on the oceans and the seas under the ambit of UNCLOS.\nThank you all very much.\nTRANSCRIPT OF KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE\nTHIRD UN CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEA AMBASSADOR TOMMY KOH\nAT THE HIGH-LEVEL COMMEMORATIVE MEETING OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO MARK THE\nTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, 29 APRIL 2022\nMr President,\nMr Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nColleagues from the Conference Secretariat,\nFriends from the Neptune group of non-governmental organisations,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWe are meeting to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which I will refer to as UNCLOS. We should treasure the convention for the following eight reasons.\nFirst, UNCLOS had put a stop to a period of chaos and unilateralism in the law of the sea. This was the situation in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In its place, we have a treaty which I have described as a \u201cconstitution for the world\u2019s oceans\u201d. UNCLOS is universally accepted as the foundation of the legal order governing the uses and resources of the oceans.\nSecond, UNCLOS has given birth to three successful institutions: the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International Seabed Authority and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. I am glad that the heads of the three institutions will be speaking to the Assembly. I am also pleased that the President of the International Court of Justice will be addressing the Assembly. I am happy to report that there is no conflict between the jurisprudence of the tribunal and that of the court on the law of the sea.\nThird, the convention imposes a clear obligation on all States to protect and preserve the marine environment. UNCLOS, I would argue, is one of our most robust environmental treaties. The convention treats the ocean space as an ecological whole and seeks to protect the oceans and the marine environment from all sources of marine pollution. I welcome the recent decision by the UN Environment Assembly to begin negotiating a new treaty on marine plastic pollution.\nFourth, UNCLOS has contributed to keeping the peace at sea. Wars can occur when there are no laws or when the laws are not clear. Many of us would not remember that two European countries went to war over fishing rights in 1972 and 1973. The clear rules in the convention on the rights and obligations of coastal States and other States in the different maritime zones are critical in avoiding conflict.\nFifth, the convention contains a system of compulsory dispute settlement. This is a unique and precious feature of the convention. It enhances the prospects that disputes between States, on the interpretation and application of the convention, will be settled peacefully. Since the convention came into force, States have made good use of the different tools provided by the convention, including arbitration, adjudication and the first successful case of compulsory conciliation.\nSixth, the convention is a post-colonial treaty and the developing countries played a major role in the making of this treaty. The convention is also a revolutionary treaty and contains many new concepts of law. The convention reflects the interests of all countries, including those of the developing countries. I would point to the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Common Heritage of Mankind to support my thesis.\nSeventh, the convention is a living document and is able to respond to new developments and challenges. I refer to the 1995 Implementation Agreement on Highly Migratory and Straddling Fish Stocks as an example. That agreement fills a gap in the convention and contains new principles of sustainable fishery. If the current negotiations, on the conservation and sustainable use of (marine) biological diversity, in areas beyond national jurisdiction, are successfully concluded, the outcome will be embodied in a new Implementation Agreement, under the convention.\nEighth, climate change and sea level rise will impact many aspects of the law of the sea. Sea level rise poses an existential threat to many countries, especially the small island developing countries. The convention contains the legal tools for us to meet this monumental challenge, but States must act and act urgently. The Secretary-General has described the situation as a Code Red for humanity.\nMr President, I shall conclude. UNCLOS is a victory for the UN, a victory for international law and the rule of law and a victory for the peaceful settlement of disputes. This victory is especially precious in our difficult times. I am glad I was able to play a very small role in this story.\nThank you very much.\nPhotos caption:Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan speaking at the high-level commemorative plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to mark the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 29 April 2022Photos credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhotos caption:Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan speaking at the high-level commemorative plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to mark the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 29 April 2022\nPhotos credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption:Ambassador-at-Large Prof Tommy Koh\u2019s keynote address (in his capacity as President of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea) at the high-level commemorative plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to mark the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, 29 April 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

The theme of the session was \u201cSmall States, Multilateralism, and International Law\u201d. Singapore and fifteen fellow small states started FOSS in 1992, and this group has now grown to 108 members\u2014a majority of the UN member states. Minister Balakrishnan emphasised in his remarks that the UN Charter confers on all states, big and small, sovereign equality under international law. A multilateral system based on international law is essential for world peace and is especially critical for the survival and prosperity of small states. Minister Balakrishnan called on the President (PGA) of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) His Excellency Abdulla Shahid. They discussed the importance of strengthening the UN\u2019s role in addressing issues like climate change and sustainable development. They also discussed the significance of the recent UNGA resolution on a \u201cStanding mandate for a General Assembly debate when a veto is cast in the Security Council\u201d in enhancing the role of the UNGA on matters of peace and security. Minister Balakrishnan met UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Mr Achim Steiner and reaffirmed the longstanding cooperation between Singapore and the UNDP, including through the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development which Singapore hosts. Minister Balakrishnan also attended a High-Level Meeting on the Implementation of the New Urban Agenda convened by PGA Shahid, where he delivered a national statement, and an ASEAN statement at the request of ASEAN Chair Cambodia.

I am sure the people who founded it were not sure that it would have withstood the test of time, but here are we are celebrating the 30th anniversary, and we now have more than a hundred countries who are members of FOSS (Forum of Small States). In fact, as the President (of the General Assembly Abdulla Shahid) has already said, the majority of UN (United Nations) Member States are also members of FOSS. As a grouping of small states from different regions of the world, we are deeply committed to bridging differences and building consensus. We have different positions and interests. There is great diversity amongst FOSS. But as small states, all of us recognise that we have a common interest to defend the principles of the UN Charter and to strengthen the multilateral system. A strong multilateral system is important for peace and security, and all the more so for small states. We need this also for sustainable development and the protection of human rights. It is no surprise that since our inception, FOSS has been an active advocate of the UN, of multilateralism, and of international law. It is very heartening to see that many small states are playing very active roles at the UN. We have just heard from the President of the General Assembly, who is also the Foreign Minister of one of the smallest states (Maldives)\u2014but I should say, only in terms of land, because if you include its Exclusive Economic Zone, in fact, Maldives is very big, certainly from the perspective of Singapore. We have the example of Botswana, a small state from Africa, who is now President of ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council). Small states have also played important roles in the UN Security Council. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small country, but it has served in the UN Security Council, and it has played an important and influential role in standing up for principles and for peace and security. We have endured as a grouping because this has given us a platform for us to amplify our voice, to make common cause, and to leverage our collective influence at the UN. As small states, we not only want to be heard at the UN, but also be treated with respect as sovereign states with equal rights and responsibilities. For small states, multilateralism and international law are our shield\u2014critical to our survival. The topic of today\u2019s roundtable is small states, multilateralism and international law. Let me just make a couple of points. First, the UN Charter provides the foundation of our multilateral system based on international law. The UN Charter confers on all states, big and small, sovereign equality under international law. The Charter enshrines the principles of the territorial integrity of all nations, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The UN Charter also imposes a duty on all states to refrain from the threat or the use of force, except in self-defence in accordance with Article 51. Second, an effective multilateral system depends on all states \u2013 big and small \u2013 respecting the UN Charter and international law. The international legal framework is not perfect. We all know that. However, compliance with the UN Charter and international law is critical for peace, security, the protection of human rights, and the economic development which all our citizens demand. The continued effectiveness of the multilateral system depends on these legal principles being progressively developed (and) codified. We have to fill in the gaps and clarify the rules in the governance of the global commons. The UN has made crucial contributions in this regard. One of the foremost examples, which the President (of the General Assembly) has already alluded to, is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, for which we commemorate the 40th anniversary tomorrow. There are many other areas of the global commons where the UN must continue to play a key role, whether it is in climate action, governance in cyberspace or outer space, or the conservation and the sustainable use of the marine environment. My third and final point is that a multilateral system based on international law is critical for the survival and prosperity of all states and especially small states. Small states have the best chance of survival when there is a stable and predictable world order that upholds the rights and sovereign equality of all states regardless of size. Small states like us are most vulnerable when the multilateral system based on international law is replaced by the idea that might makes right. Unfortunately, therefore, Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine has been a grim reminder for all states that we cannot take peace and security for granted. For small states, the war in Ukraine is a defining moment. It requires a clear and principled position. The violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of one country by another country is simply not acceptable in this day and age. For small states, it is important for us to take a principled position and speak out against violations of international law whenever and wherever they occur. Indeed, many small countries adopt a principles-based foreign policy. This means we are not taking sides, but we are prepared to stand up based on principles and international law. Let me conclude by saying that as small states, we cannot and will not remain passive. We have to speak up to defend our own national interests and our collective interests, and we must not hesitate to take a stand to defend the multilateral system and international law. Small states must work closely with other countries to build bridges and find consensus. The UN Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Our Common Agenda\u2019 Report has challenged us to think deeply, to think differently, and to think outside the box about what the future of global cooperation and the multilateral system should look like. As small states, it is incumbent on us to drive this and other discussions to ensure that the multilateral system and the rules and norms that underpin it for the coming decades are more inclusive, more networked, more effective, and more fair. I look forward to a rich discussion and an exchange of ideas during the interactive segment on how we can work together and support one another to achieve peace, security, and sustainable, inclusive, and fair development. The multilateral system serves the interests of all states, big and small, and it is important for us to strengthen the UN and the multilateral system to address the many global challenges we are facing today. As a small state, Singapore is ready to work with all countries to support multilateralism and international law. I am glad to see so many of you here, and to note that we also have big countries \u2013 I note the presence of China here today with us \u2013 hopefully to make common cause with small states as well. Thank you.\nTRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENTS BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT THE HIGH-LEVEL MEETING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW URBAN AGENDA, 28 APRIL 2022 ASEAN Statement Mr. President, It is an honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN would like to thank you, Your Excellency Abdulla Shahid, for convening today\u2019s meeting.\nSustainable urbanisation is a key priority for ASEAN. Half of ASEAN\u2019s population live in urban areas, and an additional 70 million people are expected to live in ASEAN cities by 2025. Urbanisation has also been a crucial driver of economic growth for all of us, the ten nations in ASEAN. We see this happening not only in mega-cities but also in middleweight cities, with populations between 500,000 and five million. At the same time, rapid urbanisation poses multiple challenges, many of which are exacerbated by the dual crises of COVID-19 and the ongoing climate change. COVID-19 has driven home the vulnerability of densely-populated urban areas to health threats and the need for strong public health and hygiene measures. Many cities in ASEAN are also among the most vulnerable to natural disasters in the world, particularly from rising sea levels, droughts, and floods, as a result of climate change. What we do at the local level will have a profound global impact. The pandemic has given us the opportunity to rethink, re-design, and rebuild our cities. First, we need to harness the benefits of the digital transformation while addressing its risks and challenges. Disruptive technologies including cloud computing and big data have the potential to generate up to US$625 billion in annual economic impact within ASEAN itself by 2030. But they are also estimated to potentially displace 12 to 17 million non-farm jobs in Southeast Asia. To maximise the opportunities from digitalisation, we need to improve digital connectivity, we need to equip our citizens with the necessary skills and digital literacy, we need to enhance digital financial inclusion, and to strengthen international cooperation. The ASEAN Smart Cities Network is a collaborative platform comprising 26 cities to catalyse cooperation in technological and innovative solutions. We encourage ASEAN\u2019s partners to continue their active engagement with and support to the ASEAN Smart Cities Network. Second, we need to tackle the expanding resource footprint of cities everywhere. While ASEAN\u2019s urban population has grown by around 3 percent annually, the rate of carbon dioxide emissions has increased by 6.1 percent annually. ASEAN Member States reaffirm our commitment to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement of 2015. ASEAN has also adopted a Framework for Circular Economy which sets out a structured pathway towards the long-term goals of resource efficiency, economic resilience, and sustainable growth. Third, we need to adopt a holistic approach towards urban resilience. This would require coordination across government departments, and at the national, sub-national, and crosscutting levels. On the climate front, we need to strengthen our resilience against disasters and the potential impacts of climate change. The ASEAN Disaster Resilience Outlook offers a future-oriented and innovative approach to address these emerging risks and challenges. On the economic front, we need to maintain a strong and resilient post-COVID-19 economy, by keeping our markets open and our supply chains connected. ASEAN looks forward to working with the UN, the UN-Habitat, and all our partners to build a future of smart, sustainable, and resilient cities. National Statement Mr. President, Allow me now to speak in Singapore\u2019s national capacity. As the most densely populated tiny island state in the world, sustainable development has always been a cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s development and our progress. Since our independence in 1965, Singapore has undergone rapid urbanisation and transformation, while ensuring we do so in a sustainable manner. Today, more than 40 percent of Singapore is covered in greenery such as nature reserves, parks, gardens, roadside greenery and, skyrise greenery. If you don\u2019t believe me, when you fly into Singapore, look out of the plane before you land. We are guided by three aspirations. First, to be inclusive and meet the needs of all our people. Second, to be adaptable and resilient in the face of multiple crises including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing threat of climate change. Third, to be a distinctive yet endearing city that our people can call home. Let me highlight some key strategies we have adopted at the national level. First, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 last year. This contains ambitious, concrete targets to rally our nation to build a better, cleaner and fairer future. The Green Plan is a living plan, which will evolve as we develop and refine strategies to realise our vision of a \u201ccity in nature\u201d and advance our sustainability agenda. Amongst others, we aim to plant a million more trees, add another 200 hectares of nature parks, implement 200 hectares of skyrise greenery and 300 kilometres of Nature Ways by 2030. These numbers may be small for big countries, but are meaningful for a tiny city state of only 700 square kilometres. We are also building an island-wide network of green corridors linking major parks and nature areas across Singapore called park connectors. Today, our park connectors are around 370 kilometres in length, or more than seven times the length of Singapore, to put things in perspective. We will expand our island-wide connectivity networks as part of efforts to enable every household to be within a 10-minute walk of a park by 2030. Second, we are pursuing ambitious building sustainability standards through the Singapore Green Building Masterplan. This will help us to transition to a low-carbon environment, as buildings account for over 20% of Singapore\u2019s emissions. By 2030, we aim for 80% of all buildings in Singapore to be green, for 80% of new developments to meet energy performance standards, and for our best-in-class buildings to become 80% more energy efficient. Third, we are designing our living environment to be more conducive for all groups of people. We launched the Accessible City Network initiative to enhance the accessibility of all public spaces, especially for the elderly and people with disabilities and for young children. Fourth, we remain committed to enhancing cooperation with all our partners, including especially the UN and the UN-Habitat. There is great potential for us to learn from each other\u2019s best practices and collaborate on common urban challenges. Singapore will continue to share our urban practices and offer capacity building support for other countries, including through our flagship sustainable urbanisation programmes and events such as the Singapore-UN Habitat International Leaders in Urban Governance Programme as well as the World Cities Summit. Thank you all very much.\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the Forum of Small States informal high-level roundtable convened by Singapore on 28 April 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Shahid on 28 April 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s meeting with UN Development Programme Administrator Mr Achim Steiner on 28 April 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the High Level Meeting on the Implementation of the New Urban Agenda on 28 April 2022\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

They announced the establishment of a new pillar on \u201cclimate change and green economy\u201d under the EP, which reflects the ongoing cooperation in this important area and the joint commitment to pursue closer collaboration. Cooperation under this pillar will include initiatives on energy transition technology, carbon markets, sustainable transport and waste management as a start. The Prime Ministers also welcomed the establishment of initiatives on sustainable aviation, business collaboration and supply chain resilience. The Prime Ministers welcomed the timely launch of the Vaccinated Travel Framework by Singapore from 1 April 2022, and New Zealand\u2019s reopening of borders to visa-free countries, including Singapore, from 1 May 2022. The reopening of borders is an important step towards living with COVID-19, and is critical in restoring the people-to-people and business links between both countries and with the rest of the world. The establishment of a bilateral Working Holiday Scheme will allow young Singaporeans and New Zealanders to travel and work in each other\u2019s countries. The Prime Ministers also exchanged views on key regional and international developments. They agreed on the importance of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. Both leaders strongly condemned the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and called on all parties to facilitate unhindered humanitarian assistance to those in need in Ukraine. Following the meeting, the Prime Ministers issued a Joint Statement on the key outcomes of the meeting. The full text of the Joint Statement is at Annex\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n19 APRIL 2022\nAnnex\nJOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTERS OF NEW ZEALAND AND SINGAPORE\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hosted Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern on an Official Visit to Singapore on 19 April 2022. The Prime Ministers acknowledged the longstanding friendship and multi-faceted, wide-ranging cooperation between Singapore and New Zealand across many fields, in spite of the challenges presented by COVID-19.\nReconnecting\n2. The Prime Ministers discussed their respective countries\u2019 responses to managing COVID-19. They reflected on the high value of the close cooperation and frequent discussions between health, border, transport, foreign affairs, and other officials throughout the pandemic. They welcomed reconnecting through the reopening of borders to each other, which will restore people-to-people links between the two countries.\nThe Prime Ministers welcomed a new Working Holiday Scheme for young Singaporeans and New Zealanders, who will soon once again be able to travel and work in each other\u2019s country each year.\nBilateral Cooperation\nThe Prime Ministers welcomed the excellent progress made in the Enhanced Partnership between Singapore and New Zealand, established during Prime Minister Ardern\u2019s Official Visit in 2019. The Enhanced Partnership currently covers four pillars: (a) Trade and Economics; (b) Security and Defence; (c) Science, Technology and Innovation; and (d) People-to-People links.\nThe Prime Ministers agreed to strengthen the Enhanced Partnership by adding a new pillar on \u201cClimate Change and Green Economy\u201d to better reflect our recognition of the existential threat posed by climate change and our shared commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and seize growth opportunities in the green economy. Cooperation under this pillar can include energy transition technology, carbon markets, sustainable transport, and waste management as a start. A list of agreed initiatives is in the Annex.\nAs the region adapts to evolving global trends and supply chain vulnerabilities, the Prime Ministers agreed that increasing economic resilience will be crucial. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore and New Zealand have worked together to guard against protectionism to ensure that supply chains remained open. To help build resilience against current and future supply chain disruption, the Prime Ministers agreed to launch a Singapore and New Zealand Supply Chain Working Group. They asked officials, working closely with the private sector, to identify opportunities for collaboration in support of more productive, resilient, sustainable, and digitally enhanced supply chains for enterprises of all sizes and for improved food and energy security in both countries.\nThe Prime Ministers noted the ongoing opportunities for New Zealand and Singapore companies to work together to support the growth of exports and services to South East Asia, South Asia, and beyond. New Zealand is an important producer of food and agricultural products while Singapore is a natural transport and logistics hub for New Zealand businesses. They reaffirmed the importance of further strengthening partnerships in food and agriculture between the two countries, to enhance food security and facilitate the development of innovative food systems. They agreed to strengthen the relationship between our research institutions in areas such as alternative protein as well as collaborate on the commercialisation of new food products.\nThe Prime Ministers agreed that New Zealand and Singapore will continue to strengthen defence and security cooperation including through high-level dialogues, training exercises, professional exchanges, and cooperation at multilateral fora. The Prime Ministers were pleased to note an increase in both countries\u2019 engagement on counter terrorism and exchange of maritime security insights, and climate change. The Prime Ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to the Five Powers Defence Arrangements, which marked its 50th anniversary in 2021, and to the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting-Plus.\nThe Prime Ministers noted that there have been frequent exchanges between Singapore and New Zealand cyber security experts since a Cyber Security Memorandum of Arrangement was signed in 2019. Wide-ranging discussions have covered the resilience of critical infrastructure and SMEs to cyber incidents, cyber security workforce development, Internet of Things security, ransomware and cooperation with the private sector for stronger cyber outcomes. The Prime Ministers directed their respective cyber security leads (Chief Executive of Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and the New Zealand Prime Minister\u2019s Special Representative for Cyber and Digital) to meet virtually to discuss opportunities to further deepen the cyber security partnership between the two countries.\nRegional Economic and Trade Cooperation\nThe Prime Ministers welcomed the development of stronger economic linkages between Singapore and New Zealand arising from the implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the recent entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\nThe Prime Ministers noted their support for ongoing efforts to conclude, ratify, implement and upgrade trade agreements in the region that benefit our peoples and our businesses. They also welcomed the ongoing efforts by the US to work with partners on the establishment of an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Both countries will continue to support the upgrade of the ASEAN Australia New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) as well as the expansion of existing agreements such as the CPTPP and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) to economies that can fully adhere to the agreements\u2019 high standards.\nGlobal Developments\nThe Prime Ministers exchanged views on global developments.\nThe Prime Ministers reiterated their strong condemnation of the invasion and occupation of Ukraine and demanded Russia\u2019s immediate withdrawal. They agreed that actions by Russia are a flagrant violation of fundamental principles of international law and risk long-term global instability, and called on all parties to protect civilians and respect human rights. They also called on all parties to facilitate unhindered humanitarian assistance to those in need in Ukraine.\nThe Prime Ministers reiterated their shared commitment to an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which supports and promotes free trade and open markets, and respects the rights of countries to lead their national existence free from external interference, subversion and coercion. They reaffirmed the importance of ASEAN Centrality, and agreed to continue to work closely with ASEAN in ASEAN-led mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum. They also reaffirmed their shared determination to strengthen the WTO and the rules-based multilateral trading system.\nIn the maritime domain, the Prime Ministers reaffirmed the right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas accorded by international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They reaffirmed the need to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, in particular UNCLOS, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. They affirmed the need to respect states\u2019 ability to conserve, sustainably develop, and effectively manage their maritime natural resources in accordance with international law, in particular UNCLOS. They reaffirmed that all concerned parties must abide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterated their support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS. They also affirmed the importance of acting consistently with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization.\nThe Prime Ministers shared their deep concerns regarding the situation in Myanmar following the 2021 military coup. Both Prime Ministers agreed that the Five-Point Consensus on Myanmar adopted at the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting on 24 April 2021 should be fully implemented as soon as possible and reiterated calls for the violence to end, for inclusive dialogue between all parties in Myanmar, for the release of all political detainees including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and foreign detainees, and for the Myanmar military authorities to avoid actions that would be inimical to eventual national reconciliation in Myanmar. They appreciated the constructive role played by ASEAN in facilitating a peaceful solution in the interest of the people of Myanmar. Singapore and New Zealand also remain committed to supporting ASEAN\u2019s efforts in alleviating the humanitarian situation in Myanmar.\nThe Prime Ministers reiterated their support for multilateral and UN engagement on Myanmar including the work of the UN Special Envoy for the Secretary General and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar and called for UN representatives and agencies to be granted full access to Myanmar.\nBoth Prime Ministers underscored that New Zealand and Singapore are staunch supporters of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. They agreed that New Zealand and Singapore will continue to work together to strengthen their bilateral relationship and uphold international law and the multilateral system, and to stay in close contact on regional and global issues of concern. On climate change specifically, the Prime Ministers acknowledged the need for intensified global effort to counter climate change, and committed to work together to build on the outcomes of the COP26 in Glasgow and the recommendations of the latest deeply concerning IPCC reports.\nBoth Prime Ministers also agreed that to ensure global security, prosperity and the meeting of challenges such as climate change in the coming decades, it is important to support regional and global institutions and approaches that facilitate constructive dialogue between all countries.\nINITIATIVES FOR THE NEW \u201cCLIMATE CHANGE AND GREEN ECONOMY\u201d PILLAR UNDER THE SINGAPORE-NEW ZEALAND ENHANCED PARTNERSHIP"

They explored ways to deepen bilateral relations in areas such as green, digital, and cybersecurity cooperation. Minister Balakrishnan highlighted that there are over 2,100 German companies in Singapore, involved in key sectors such as finance, research and development (R&D), and engineering.

I am glad to be back in Germany, as I have on numerous occasions in different incarnations. But I do wish we were meeting in happier circumstances.\nThe world has changed profoundly. I think it becomes even more crucial that this vital partnership that we have between Germany and Singapore is worth reinforcing and affirming, especially at a time like this. Both Germany and Singapore are staunch supporters of an inclusive, rules-based, and peaceful international order. This has been a shared belief that has been the bedrock of our excellent cooperation in multiple areas, ranging from business, finance, defence, education, culture, (and) sports. Germany is Singapore\u2019s largest goods trading partner in the EU (European Union). Just to give some numbers to this, in 2021, bilateral trade in goods totalled S$23.4 billion. In fact, it is a 17.7% increase from the year before. The point is, all this is occurring with COVID-19 in the backdrop. So it is a positive account. I mentioned earlier there are (over) 2,100 German companies based in Singapore. There is even a German school in my constituency. These companies are engaged in key sectors like finance, research and development (R&D), (and) engineering. I am also glad that Singapore has seen an increase in investments from German Mittelstand champions who have been expanding their local R&D teams in Singapore. At a bloc-to-bloc level, the EU is ASEAN\u2019s (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) third largest trading partner. ASEAN is likewise the EU\u2019s third largest trading partner outside Europe. We discussed and we both agreed that there is much potential to do more, especially in new and exciting areas like cybersecurity (and) green sustainable development. We also believe that we need to further strengthen people-to-people ties between our two nations, and between our countries and regions in the years ahead.\n3 I am glad to report that we have continued this close collaboration and mutual support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of us have weathered the Omicron waves. I believe we are both on the recovery side of that wave, and we have progressively relaxed our border measures. I am glad to report, certainly for the Germans who are thinking of traveling, that with effect from 1st April, all vaccinated travellers from Germany can enter Singapore. All you need is one test in Germany before you leave. After that, it is business-as-usual. You will be welcome in Singapore as much as you were welcome before COVID-19 reared its head. So I look forward to welcoming all of you to Singapore in the very near future. It is also worth emphasising that throughout the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years, our supply chains between Germany and Singapore were never interrupted. Flows of essential goods, services, vaccines, drugs, pharmaceuticals, food \u2013 all continued unabated. The true test of a relationship is when there are times of stress. We did not let each other down in this time of stress. That has built even more strategic trust for the future.\n4 Germany and Singapore also share a profound belief in multilateralism. We have always worked together closely both at regional and international fora. In 2020, under Germany\u2019s Presidency of the EU Council and Singapore\u2019s Country Coordinatorship of the ASEAN-EU Dialogue Relations, we elevated the relations between the EU and ASEAN to a Strategic Partnership. Last year, ASEAN and the EU also concluded a historic Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, which is the world\u2019s first bloc-to-bloc aviation agreement.\n5 We also discussed the very painful situation in Ukraine. I think we have both seen the photographs and videos from Bucha. Words will not be able to define the horror of the pain and suffering that innocent civilians pay in this horrendous war. In the case of Singapore, we are standing to uphold existential principles. We may be far away from this conflict, but the fundamental principles of territorial integrity, respect for the independence and sovereignty of nations, and to be free of the threat of being attacked by other nations \u2013 these principles are enshrined in the UN (United Nations) Charter. To us, these are essential pillars for peace and prosperity in the world. That is why although we are a tiny city state far away from Europe, we decided that we needed to take a stand. Not take sides, but to take a stand on principle. Singapore therefore has strongly condemned the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and we have also imposed sanctions and restrictions to constrain Russia\u2019s capacity to conduct war against the Ukrainian people and to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine.\n6 We hope and pray that there will be an immediate ceasefire. The people of Ukraine deserve so much more than has been visited on them in the last six weeks. We hope there will be a peaceful resolution, in accordance with the UN Charter and international law. There must be safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and those most directly affected by the crisis. I am confident that Germany will continue to play an especially crucial role, and especially during the G7 Presidency.\n7 Let me conclude by thanking Minister Baerbock for her strong commitment and support to deepen the relations between not only our two countries, but our two regions. I am happy to continue to work with you to elevate our bilateral cooperation to new heights. I have issued two invitations to you to visit Singapore this year. We have much to do in an unsettled world, in a time when so much is at stake and so much is changing. We look forward to this essential collaboration with Germany as we deal with this new world with all its attendant problems and opportunities.\n8 Thank you very much for your welcome.\nQ&A\nS\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung (Paul-Anton Kr\u00fcger): Foreign Minister, with China more or less openly siding with Russia in that conflict, or in that war, what does the role of China in this war mean for stability in your region and what would you advise to your European colleagues when they are recalibrating their relationships with China in regard of that conflict? Thank you very much.\nMinister: Thank you. As I said just now, we may be very far away from this current conflict, but it has profound implications to the whole world, including the Asia-Pacific. At the first level, I have already explained that as a matter of principle, violating the UN (United Nations) Charter, (and) transgressing territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of nations is a clear and present danger to the system of nation states and globalisation, which in a sense, began in Germany, (in) Westphalia. It was a world in which all countries, big and small, would have a voice, would have access to peaceful resolution of dispute, (and) would behave within accepted norms of international behaviour. All this is now at risk. There is another level at which this conflict is salient, and that is that it complicates the already difficult relationship between the United States and China.\nIn the last two months, I have been to Beijing, (and) I have been to Washington, D.C., before arriving here. Let me just quote what the Chinese Ambassador to the US (Qin Gang) said on the 20th of March 2022. Let me quote him: \u201cWe should be clear that China-Russia cooperation has no limits, but it does have a bottom line. That is the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.\u201d\nI think we should pay attention to what has been said, and understand that China has got multiple interests in this situation. But I would like to believe that all of us want to see an end to the hostility, an end to the suffering of the Ukrainian people who are innocent victims, and a restoration of the norms of international behaviour.\nI have been coming to Germany over many years, and every time you come to Berlin, it is a pilgrimage to go to the Berlin Wall. I am old enough to remember watching the scenes as the Wall came down. 1989 in Germany represented the zenith of the post-World War Two Order.\nIf you think about what happened in the aftermath of post-World War Two, it was a world order in which America had 40% of global GDP.\nAmerica was prepared to envision and underwrite a world order defined by the United Nations, international law, the Bretton Woods Institutions, World Bank, IMF (International Monetary Fund). It was prepared to help support international economic integration, the growth of multinational corporations, the free flow of capital, goods, and services. Actually, for those of us in Asia, this was a formula for peace and prosperity, and we all gained from it. In fact, the biggest beneficiary, actually was China. Of course, clearly the rest of us in Southeast Asia as well.\nTherefore, we watch what is happening in Europe now with grave concern, because if suddenly all those pillars of globalisation are shaken, then we are into a very uncertain and difficult future ahead. Yet, all these strategic calculations are also occurring at a time when there is a need for a green global reset, an energy transformation and a digital revolution.\nIt is our hope that we do not repeat the need to enter into new world wars, but we can fast forward and arrive at new arrangements for a post-World War scenario. One in which all countries can be safe, can focus on the opportunities that the green economy will bring, and the digital opportunities as well, and hopefully create a new age of peace and prosperity. So that really is our hope, and I am just sharing a perspective from Southeast Asia.\nPhoto Caption: Meeting between Singapore\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on 4 April 2022\nPhoto Credit:Janine Schmitz\nPhoto Caption:Joint Press Conference between Singapore\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on 4 April 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption:Delegation meeting between Singapore\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on 4 April 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

With respect to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while the UN Security Council has the mandate under Article 51 of the UN Charter to take action as it deems necessary \u201cin order to maintain or restore international peace and security\u201d, this is unlikely to be invoked given Russia\u2019s veto power as a Permanent Member of the Security Council.\nSingapore has taken a clear, consistent, and principled position on upholding international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, as laid out in the Ministerial Statement in Parliament on 28 February 2022 on Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. We co-sponsored and voted in favour of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session Resolution ES-11/1 on \u201cAggression against Ukraine\u201d which was adopted by a vote of 141 YES \u2013 5 NO \u2013 35 ABSTAIN on 2 March 2022. While UN General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, as a responsible member of the international community, Singapore has complied with the spirit and letter of the resolution. Given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian invasion and Russia\u2019s veto of the UN Security Council resolution, Singapore has further imposed sanctions aimed at constraining Russia\u2019s capacity to conduct war against Ukraine and undermine its sovereignty. Specifically, we have imposed a ban on the transfer to Russia of all items in the Military Goods List and all items in the \u201cElectronics\u201d, \u201cComputers\u201d, and \u201cTelecommunications and Information Security\u201d categories of the Dual-Use Goods List of the Strategic Goods (Control) Order 2021. We have also imposed financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, and fund-raising activities benefiting the Russian government. Further details can be found in MFA\u2019s Press Statement on Sanctions and Restrictions against Russia in Response to its Invasion of Ukraine dated 5 March 2022.\nSingapore has supported humanitarian assistance efforts, with the Singapore Government contributing US$100,000 to assist affected communities in Ukraine via the Singapore Red Cross, which is working through the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We co-sponsored and voted in favour of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session Resolution on \u201cHumanitarian Consequences of the Aggression against Ukraine\u201d which was adopted by a vote of 140 YES \u2013 5 NO \u2013 38 ABSTAIN on 24 March 2022.\nMr de Souza has also asked about ASEAN\u2019s approach. ASEAN is deeply concerned about the unfolding crisis and worsening humanitarian conditions from Russia\u2019s unlawful invasion of Ukraine. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers have thus far issued two statements. First, on 26 February 2022, to call on all relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint, to make utmost efforts to pursue dialogue, de-escalate tensions and seek peaceful resolution in accordance with international law, and uphold the principles of mutual respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and equal rights of all nations. Second, on 3 March 2022, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the continuation of political dialogue which would lead to sustainable peace in Ukraine.\nLastly, Mr de Souza has asked about the efforts being made to allow negotiations to take place between Russia and Ukraine. While Singapore is not involved in the ongoing direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, we note that both sides have undertaken several rounds of negotiations since 28 February 2022. We hope that these talks will lead to a peaceful settlement in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.\nWe will continue to work alongside the international community to support international law, a rules-based international order, and a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n5 APRIL 2022"

        "content": "Source: PMO\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is currently on a working visit to the United States, had a bilateral meeting with President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the Oval Office on 29 March 2022. They reaffirmed the robust, enduring and multi-faceted Singapore-United States partnership and welcomed new areas of cooperation, including: (i) the renewal and expansion of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to Deepen Cooperation on Infrastructure Development; (ii) the establishment of the United States-Singapore Cyber Dialogue; and (iii) Singapore\u2019s signing of the Artemis Accords.\nPrime Minister Lee welcomed President Biden\u2019s strong commitment to engage the region and ASEAN. Both leaders exchanged views on international and regional developments, including the crisis in Ukraine, and reaffirmed their shared commitment to a stable, rules-based global order.\nFollowing the Oval Office meeting, Prime Minister Lee and President Biden issued a Joint Leaders\u2019 Statement. The text of the U.S.-Singapore Joint Leaders\u2019 Statement is at Annex.\nPRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE SINGAPORE 29 MARCH 2022\nAnnex\nPresident Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is honored to welcome Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong to Washington, D.C. The U.S.-Singapore strategic partnership is anchored in our shared respect for the rules-based international order, adherence to international law, and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter \u2013 including respect for sovereignty, the peaceful resolution of disputes, cooperation among nations, and fundamental human rights. These principles have underpinned decades of unprecedented peace and stability as well as economic and social development, in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.\nThe United States and Singapore recognize that threats to the UN Charter and rules-based international order anywhere, including Russia\u2019s unprovoked attack on Ukraine, place peace and prosperity everywhere at risk. The war in Ukraine has a negative impact on the Indo-Pacific region, which already faces many complex challenges. Taken together, the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century demand deeper cooperation between us.\nThe leaders welcome the enduring strength of the bilateral strategic partnership, marked by Singapore\u2019s unique status as a Major Security Cooperation Partner, by the 5,400 U.S. companies that call Singapore home, by the countries\u2019 close people-to-people ties, and by the series of high-level bilateral visits during the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration. The leaders resolve to further expand bilateral cooperation, taking bold new steps to drive broad-based economic growth and innovation, raise infrastructure standards in the region, address the climate crisis, promote health security, increase supply chain resilience, improve cybersecurity, ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, and more. As we strengthen our partnership, we will promote a world in which all nations, large and small, can stand together as equals to tackle the most pressing challenges of our era and deliver for our people.\nUpholding the Rules-Based International Order\nPresident Biden reiterates the sustained and growing commitment of the United States to its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as described in the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee reaffirm their strong support for ASEAN Centrality and the ASEAN-centered regional architecture. Prime Minister Lee welcomes President Biden\u2019s invitation to ASEAN leaders for a historic ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in Washington, D.C. The leaders highlight the success of the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program, which has received more than 1700 officials from across ASEAN. The United States seeks cooperation with all partners who share our objectives in the Indo-Pacific region, and to that end, we welcome the Quad\u2019s support for ASEAN Centrality, deeper economic integration, addressing of regional challenges, and promotion of an open, inclusive, stable and secure Indo-Pacific region and a rules-based order. We also welcome the enhanced engagement of European and regional partners in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.\nThe United States and Singapore emphasize our unwavering commitment to the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and condemn Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which clearly violates international law, including the United Nations Charter. The United States and Singapore recognize the need to preserve a world in which borders cannot be changed by force and state-to-state relations are guided by international law. Given the unprovoked attack on Ukraine, many countries across the Atlantic and the Pacific, including the United States and Singapore, have imposed their own financial sanctions and export controls against Russian entities. The United States and Singapore will ensure the effective implementation of their respective measures. The United States and Singapore are deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in and around Ukraine, and call on all parties to allow safe and unfettered passage of civilians, facilitate unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, protect civilians, and respect human rights.\nAmid global security challenges, the United States and Singapore continue to build on our partnership to pursue our shared interests. The leaders reaffirm a shared commitment to the goal of the complete denuclearization and the establishment of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. Both leaders call on the DPRK to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy and emphasize the importance of full implementation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The leaders underscore the importance of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee also reflected on the close counterterrorism partnership shared by the United States and Singapore, and Singapore\u2019s support of the United States relocation efforts related to Afghanistan last year.\nIn the maritime domain, the United States and Singapore reaffirm the right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas accorded by international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We reaffirm the need to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. We respect states\u2019 ability to conserve, sustainably develop, and effectively manage their maritime natural resources in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. We reaffirm that all concerned parties must abide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterate our support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS. We also affirm the importance of acting consistently with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization.\nThe United States and Singapore share deep concerns about the situation in Myanmar and the challenges it poses to regional stability. We continue to call for an end to violence against civilians in Myanmar, the release of all political detainees, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and foreign detainees; unhindered humanitarian access; and for Myanmar to return to its path of democratic transition. We appreciate the constructive role played by Singapore and ASEAN in facilitating a peaceful solution in the interest of the people of Myanmar, and we call for the Myanmar military regime to urgently implement the ASEAN Five Point Consensus. We are concerned the crisis has reversed years of economic progress in Myanmar and increased the risk of illicit finance.\nDriving Inclusive Prosperity and Addressing Emerging Challenges\nPresident Biden and Prime Minister Lee underscore their shared commitment to promoting broad-based economic growth in the United States, in Singapore, and throughout the region. They reaffirm the close collaboration between the United States and Singapore on developing an Indo-Pacific economic framework with regional partners that will expand cooperation on trade, supply chains, clean energy, decarbonization, infrastructure, tax, and anti-corruption. They welcome Thailand\u2019s leadership as host of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 2022, and look forward to the United States hosting APEC in 2023. The leaders reviewed ongoing efforts to facilitate regional trade and increase supply chain resilience and looked forward to the implementation of the U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures initiative.\nThe leaders also look forward to expanding economic cooperation under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI), which aims to secure inclusive growth for our economies and regions in new and forward-looking areas: digital economy, energy and environmental technology, advanced manufacturing, and health services. New initiatives announced under the PGI include the development of interoperable ethical Artificial Intelligence governance frameworks, and plans for a U.S. business development mission to Singapore to facilitate new business opportunities and strengthen partnerships in advanced manufacturing.\nPresident Biden and Prime Minister Lee commit to deepening cooperation between the United States and Singapore on high quality infrastructure development in the region. To that end, the United States and Singapore renewed and expanded the MOU to deepen cooperation on infrastructure development to cover new collaborations in green and sustainable infrastructure projects in the region that address social and economic needs and promote inclusive, private sector-led growth.\nThe climate crisis poses an existential threat to the world. Recognizing the need to enhance ambition in this decisive decade, the United States has put forward an ambitious target to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030 and to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, and Singapore has announced it will raise its climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century, and will be making a formal revision to both its Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) later this year after consulting closely with key stakeholders. We commit to strengthening the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership, and we look forward to working with other countries to implement the Paris Agreement. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee recognize that decarbonizing the shipping sector is essential to transitioning to a clean energy economy and they commit to working together to advance green shipping, including by establishing alternative bunkering infrastructure for the provision of low- and zero-carbon fuels at our ports.\nThe United States and Singapore highlight their shared commitment to bolstering global health security and building back better from the COVID-19 pandemic, and preparing for further pandemics and other shocks to health systems. We must work with allies and partners to strengthen and finance vaccine readiness and accelerate efforts to control COVID-19 globally, for example by working with global health organizations such as the World Health Organization, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\nThe United States and Singapore affirm the importance of ensuring that critical and emerging technologies foster an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual trust, confidence, and respect for a rules-based international order. To this end, we commit to increasing resiliency in our technology supply chains, and developing robust approaches to data governance and security, seeking consistency and interoperability where feasible. We also plan to explore R&D and other collaborations, including through the PGI, in order to progress towards affordable, resilient, secure and interoperable advanced high-speed wireless communications (\u201cNextG\u201d) in the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe United States and Singapore maintain a strong and growing partnership on cybersecurity. We seek global adherence to the UN framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace and pledge to deepen our cooperation on combating cyber threats, promoting resilience, and securing our critical infrastructure, amongst other issues. We welcome the establishment of the United States-Singapore Cyber Dialogue to cement our cross institutional linkages to jointly tackle cybersecurity issues. We will continue to jointly lead critical efforts in the International Counter Ransomware Initiative to tackle the surge in ransomware attacks worldwide.\nThe United States and Singapore believe in the importance of creating a safe, stable, secure, and sustainable space environment that facilitates space exploration, science, and commercial activities that benefit all of humanity. President Biden welcomes Singapore\u2019s commitment to the Artemis Accords. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee also welcome the convening of a United States-Singapore Space Dialogue.\nToday\u2019s challenges all demand closer cooperation between us. For many decades the United States and Singapore have worked together to overcome the challenges of the day, and we will continue to do so, with determination and resolve. Together, we are deepening our strategic partnership to seize opportunities and address emerging threats. We are defending and strengthening the rules-based international order that has long supported global security and prosperity, and will continue to do so long into the future.\n@font-face {font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face {font-family:Calibri; panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-GB; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}p.MsoNoSpacing, li.MsoNoSpacing, div.MsoNoSpacing {mso-style-priority:1; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-GB; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}"

They welcomed the strengthening of cooperation in areas such as innovation and technology, trade and investment, R&D and education. The Singapore-Israel Industrial Research & Development Foundation (SIIRD) would be celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2022 and has funded about 190 projects since its inception in 1997, providing about US$120 million to projects between Singapore and Israel. Minister Balakrishnan highlighted that Singapore and Israel should deepen collaboration in emerging areas such as agri-food tech, health-tech, AI and digitalisation, as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. To strengthen the innovation partnership between Singapore and Israel, Singapore would establish an Embassy in Tel Aviv to serve as a focal point and support Singapore companies seeking to expand their collaboration with potential Israeli partners. Minister Balakrishnan and Minister Farkash-Hacohen also signed a MOU on cooperation in AI between Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology. The MOU signals both countries' intent to accelerate cross-border collaborations in AI, and supports the development and deployment of AI for collective benefit.

Singapore has a longstanding and principled support for a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security, in order to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution. Singapore hopes that both the Israeli and Palestinian sides would find ways to engage in direct negotiations on the basis of a two-state solution. All parties should refrain from any unilateral actions that could increase tensions and undermine the prospects for peace. Minister Balakrishnan is scheduled to visit technology investment platform OurCrowd and meet prominent personalities in Israel\u2019s technology industry later this evening.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 21 MARCH 2022\nPhoto Caption:Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan meets with Israel Alternate Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan signs an MOU on AI cooperation with Israel Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan signs an MOU on AI cooperation with Israel Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen\nLeft to right: Non-Resident Ambassador-designate of the Republic of Singapore to the State of Israel Lim Chuan Poh, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen, Israeli Ambassador to Singapore Sagi Karni\nPhoto Credit: Miri Shimonovich\nPhoto Credit: Miri Shimonovich"

It is a long-standing, complex, inter-communal issue. The current political instability in Myanmar has further complicated the situation. There are reports of the resumption of conflict between the Myanmar military and armed groups in the Rakhine State, which have further diminished the prospect of the safe, voluntary and dignified return of refugees.\n2 Despite the challenges, ASEAN has pressed on with efforts to facilitate the safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation of refugees. Singapore has strongly supported these efforts. ASEAN\u2019s work has primarily focussed on helping to improve ground conditions in the Rakhine State. The Preliminary Needs Assessment (PNA) and the ASEAN Secretariat\u2019s Ad-Hoc Support Team was established to monitor the implementation of the PNA. However, progress has stalled given the current political instability in Myanmar, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we are prepared to send further consignments of aid and stand ready to support future comprehensive needs assessments once repatriation commences so that we can be more targeted in helping the displaced persons.\n3 Additionally, Singapore has contributed over S$1 million in bilateral humanitarian aid to both Bangladesh and Myanmar to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of displaced persons. There are ongoing community efforts to provide aid. We have also made contributions through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management.\n4 Ultimately, peace and security in the Rakhine State requires a comprehensive political solution that addresses the fundamental causes of the conflict, and which takes into account the concerns of all ethnic communities. There are no quick fixes. Singapore will continue to work with ASEAN to support efforts to bring peace, stability, the rule of law, promote harmony and reconciliation among the various communities, as well as to ensure sustainable and equitable development in the Rakhine State.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n4 MARCH 2022"

The theme of promoting Sustainable Development Goal-sensitive investments is most apt.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a major setback for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Even before the pandemic struck, progress towards the 17 SDGs was already patchy. Progress has now slowed even further, and in some cases, seen reversals. The numbers from the latest Sustainable Development Goals Report 2021 are cause for concern. Global extreme poverty rose for the first time since 1998. Between 119 and 124 million people have been pushed back into poverty and chronic hunger.\nAs we recover from the pandemic, we must build back our societies in a more resilient and sustainable way, and this will not be easy. Beyond tighter fiscal constraints, there are other broader challenges. For example, our current consumption of the finite planetary resources is unsustainable. Our water, sanitation, food supply infrastructure remain inadequate and vulnerable in many parts of the world. The pandemic has also exposed and exacerbated problems such as inequality within and between nations. If we do not address these issues head on, our world will not have the capacity to tackle greater challenges like climate change or future pandemics.\nThe SDGs have been an important road map for humanity as agreed by over 190 countries in 2015. The development gaps which the pandemic revealed are precisely the challenges which the SDGs aim to address. What we need now is more effective mobilisation of financing for SDG-sensitive investments to fill these development gaps, especially when fiscal resources have become more constrained due to the pandemic. Finance plays an essential role in channelling resources to the right priorities. And the need for sustainable financing is great.\nThe good news is that banks and investors are increasingly taking Environmental, Social and Governance factors, or ESG for short, into account when deciding where to invest. About one-fifth of all assets worldwide are now in funds that use some form of ESG criteria. For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the MAS, has committed US$1.8 billion of its reserves to climate-related investments.\nHowever, the current global level of SDG investment is far from sufficient. According to the OECD, an estimated US$7 trillion in infrastructure investments is needed each year till 2030 to meet climate and development objectives. ASEAN alone will need an estimated US$200 billion in green investment annually through 2030 in order to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth.\nThe challenges in enhancing sustainable financing are well-known. First, many companies do not keep reliable or transparent climate-related data such as their projects\u2019 emission trajectories or energy consumption. Climate-related financial disclosure standards are still being developed. These gaps can give room for selective reporting and inconsistent disclosures by companies, making it difficult for investors to make SDG-sensitive decisions.\nSecond, there is no common definition or taxonomy for activities that contribute to climate goals. Without a common understanding of what activities are \u201cgreen\u201d, cross-border green finance flows will be constrained.\nThird, many companies lack the expertise to quantify environmental costs and the benefits of their projects.\nThis is where governments, monetary authorities, and the private sector need to work together to create an ecosystem for sustainable financing to take off. Each has a role to play. Let me elaborate.\nFirst, governments must lead the way by laying out the vision, framework, and rules for sustainable financing. In Singapore, the Government launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 in 2021 \u2013 an ambitious long-term plan to build a green, liveable and sustainable future, which covers areas from our infrastructure, urban planning and to building a green economy. This clear direction sends a message to the private sector to shift their investment position and to recognise that ESG is consistent with their fiduciary duties.\nEqually important, governments must raise public awareness of the SDGs and build capabilities to deliver on SDG investment. This includes engaging relevant partners to equip our people with the knowledge and skills needed. In this connection, Singapore is pleased to host the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development which has partnered our agencies to co-create innovative solutions for sustainable development in areas such as digital agriculture, smart cities, and sustainable finance.\nSecond, monetary authorities will need to complement the government\u2019s efforts to develop the green finance solutions and markets. This may include the promotion of sustainable financing instruments, as well as the development of a common taxonomy on sustainable activities for financial institutions. MAS has been very active in these areas. More than S$8 billion in green, social and sustainability bonds have been issued in Singapore since 2017 to provide the private sector with incentives to embed sustainability considerations in their financing decisions.\nMAS also convened a Green Finance Industry Taskforce to develop an industry taxonomy for Singapore-based financial institutions. MAS is actively participating in efforts to develop a regional taxonomy, taking into account international goals, while tailoring it to ASEAN\u2019s context. MAS is setting out roadmaps for mandatory climate-related financial disclosures by financial institutions and listed entities which will facilitate the comparison of climate-related investments. My colleague, Dr Darian McBain, Chief Sustainability Officer from MAS, will shed more light on this.\nLastly, the private sector is a crucial player. There are greater expectations from investors and consumers that companies incorporate ESG and channel resources towards sustainable business activities. These developments will drive SDG investments and should be scaled up. One example in Singapore is the Climate Impact X \u2013 a joint initiative by Temasek, DBS, SGX and the Standard Chartered Bank to offer different financial products to cater to the needs of carbon credit buyers. This dovetails with Singapore\u2019s aspirations to become a thriving carbon marketplace and demonstrates our support for Asia\u2019s transition towards greater sustainability.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nDespite the impact of COVID-19, there are glimmers of hope. We have seen a shared sense of responsibility where governments, regulators, businesses and individuals come together to tackle the challenges brought about by the pandemic. If we can bring the same spirit of togetherness in scaling up SDG-sensitive investments, there is hope that we can move closer towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.\nWe look forward to supporting the UNDP\u2019s efforts to promote greater investments in the SDGs, including through the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development. Sustainable finance is already one of the Centre\u2019s key priorities, and it would be timely to explore how we can further expand our collaboration, bring others on board.\nI am confident that this policy dialogue, its distinguished panel of speakers and the esteemed panellists will provide valuable insights on how sustainable financing can be enhanced. I wish you all a fruitful discussion that will pave the way for concrete collaboration.\nThank you all very much.\nPhoto Caption: Call on Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies Heng Swee Keat by United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Call on Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam by United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari\nFrom left to right: United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative for Singapore Niloy Banerjee; United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific Kanni Wignaraja; United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari; Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption:\nCall on Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu by United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari\nFrom left to right: United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific Kanni Wignaraja; United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Usha Rao Monari; Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Visit to ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence by United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Ms Usha Rao Monari, hosted by Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo\nFrom left to right: United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, Ms Kanni Wignaraja; United Nations Under-Secretary-General and United Nations Development Programme Associate Administrator Ms Usha Rao Monari; Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo; and Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Information Ms Rahayu Mahzam\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Singapore"

He co-chaired a roundtable discussion on Connectivity and Digital Issues alongside European Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen. The Forum was hosted by France in its capacity as the President of the Council of the European Union.\nAt the roundtable, Minister Balakrishnan spoke about the transition from a unipolar to a multipolar world, the need for interoperable, common and open standards whilst protecting privacy amidst the digital revolution, and the shared challenge of the global commons. Our digital interactions must be based on trust, protection of privacy, cybersecurity and inclusion. Minister Balakrishnan also reiterated Singapore\u2019s grave concern with the escalation of tensions at the Ukraine-Russia border, and the Russian decision to recognise two breakaway Ukrainian regions. The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected. Minister Balakrishnan hoped that all parties would be able to make some movement towards peaceful settlement in accordance with international law. Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s opening and closing remarks are appended.\nMinister Balakrishnan will meet counterparts from India and Netherlands on the sidelines of the Forum later today.\nMinister Balakrishnan will depart Paris for Singapore on 23 February 2022.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n22 FEBRUARY 2022\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\u2019S OPENING AND CLOSING REMARKS AT THE ROUNDTABLE ON CONNECTIVITY AND DIGITAL ISSUES AT THE MINISTERIAL FORUM ON COOPERATION IN THE INDO-PACIFIC IN PARIS, 22 FEBRUARY 2022\nOpening Remarks\n1 Thank you, Commissioner UrpilainenI thank France for organising the Forum and giving us a chance to participate. I am going to just make three quick points. First, we are transiting from a unipolar moment to a multipolar world. Second, it is about the digital technology. Third, the issue of the global commons.\n2 On the first point, if we needed a reminder that this was a multipolar world, I think we just had that last night. The situation along the Ukraine-Russia border shows that other poles are live as well. The more important point I wanted to emphasise is that in this multipolar world, the EU (European Union) is a critical pole. What happens in the EU\u2019s front yard or backyard has got salience for us in Southeast Asia.We, in Singapore, remain gravely concerned with the escalation of tensions at the Ukraine-Russia border, and the Russian decision to recognise two breakaway Ukrainian regions. The reason we are concerned is because the independence, the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected. That is the way we hope, would be a universal norm applied across the world, and especially in our part of the world. We hope that all parties will be able to make some movement towards peaceful settlement in accordance with international law \u2013 another crucial ingredient for engaging with our part of the world, and to avoid actions that will further raise tensions. On this score, I also want to remind the EU, that you were in Southeast Asia first for centuries, and you continue to have significant equities and significant goodwill \u2013 you do not really need to reinvent a new vehicle. But it is (about) rediscovering your old ties, your reservoirs of goodwill, and your head start.\n3 Second, on digital, I wanted to make a point that I believe that the digital revolution is probably going to be as profound and impactful on the distribution of global prosperity and politics as the Industrial Revolution. I think the only reason I am speaking English today is because the Industrial Revolution began in Europe. If you believe that artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology are going to transform economics, and the social fabric of our society, then this is a big thing. For us, ensuring interoperability and common and open standards, whilst protecting privacy\u2013 this is something the Europeans are concerned with. I think allowing us to achieve that kind of regime is absolutely crucial. Of course, it also refers to investments in hardware, connectivity, submarine cables, and equally important, education and training, in order to create opportunities for our people.\n4 My third and final point is on global commons, climate change, pandemic preparations, and the larger and deeper political issues confronting all of us on managing inequality in the midst of a new technological revolution \u2013 a common challenge. There again is an opportunity for us to exchange notes, learn with, and work with the EU.\n5 So thank you very much, and I look forward to a productive discussion. Please be robust and frank and lets have a fruitful session together. Thank you all.\nClosing Remarks\nThank you excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. We had an excellent, free-ranging discussion at our roundtable with Commissioner Urpilainen. We had a very good discussion. I just want to quickly run through some key points.\n2 The digital economy and the transformation that it is going to effect across the world is one giant opportunity, especially for the EU to pursue in the Indo-Pacific. The points however, are that there are some attributes which are absolutely essential \u2013 trust, protection of privacy, cybersecurity and inclusion. In order to achieve an interaction and a system for the future which includes these attributes, we discussed the need for high quality infrastructure. We (also) discussed the need for finance, proper market due diligence for financing for infrastructure, the need for digital systems both in Europe and the Indo-Pacific to be able to interoperate in order to maximise value from our systems, the need for continued investments in connectivity, including more submarine cables and the security of submarine cables, and the legal regimes that protect the sanctity of this hardware.\n3 We also emphasised the need for partnerships. On this note, let me give you an idea of some of the partnerships which I am familiar with coming from Singapore. We have concluded the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement with partners like Australia, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. These establish a framework for Government-to-Government cooperation, to shape international rules and benchmarks, to ensure interoperability in areas which are important for cross-border digital transactions and to establish common understanding on standards and governance models. This is particularly important when you deal with emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.\n4 We also have signed a pathfinder plurilateral agreement. We have established common rules with digital trade to foster cooperation on emerging digital economy issues with Chile and New Zealand. I should add that this small plurilateral agreement with three small countries has now attracted the attention of a certain large neighbour in Asia. It just shows you that the sky is the limit. We look forward to concluding the Digital and Emerging Technologies Partnership with France. I am pleased that Singapore and the EU are working towards a comprehensive and forward looking digital partnership. We hope to see more cooperation towards a global architecture that is open, inclusive, interoperable, meets the needs of diverse stakeholders, and most important, based on trust and win-win paradigms. On that note, let me thank all the Ministers who participated in the roundtable, and the Commissioner (Urpilainen) for facilitating our excellent discussion. Thank you very much.\nPhoto Caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan with High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell and French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on 22 February 2022\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan co-chairing the Roundtable on Digital and Connectivity at the Ministerial Forum on Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific in Paris on 22 February 2022\nPhoto Credit: France Diplomatie"

        "date": "14 Feb 2022, 22:25",
        "country": "",
        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: (a) what plans are taken to render humanitarian or financial aid to our neighbouring countries which have been affected by the recent floods or natural disasters; and (b) what are the international efforts in developing technology or other measures to prevent or mitigate the environmental or economical effects of such disasters in the future.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian Balakrishnan: Two of our close neighbouring countries recently suffered from natural disasters. Heavy downpours pounded Malaysia in December 2021 and early-January 2022, leading to flooding in parts of Kuala Lumpur and nine other states. Malaysian media reported that at least 54 people had been killed, and over 70,000 victims evacuated to relief centres. The floods have since receded, and disaster relief is ongoing.\nTyphoon Rai made landfall in the southern and central regions of the Philippine archipelago on 16 December 2021. The Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported 409 deaths and over 1,350 injured, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated that around 1.2 million people in the Philippines were affected by Typhoon Rai, with an estimated 488,000 people displaced. Military aircraft and naval vessels were deployed for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance operations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an emergency appeal for 20 million Swiss francs (US$21.7 million) to fund relief and recovery efforts.\nThe floods in Malaysia and Typhoon Rai in the Philippines resulted in the loss of many lives and widespread destruction of property, causing hardship and suffering to the affected communities. As a fellow ASEAN member state, Singapore stands by Malaysia and the Philippines during this difficult time. I wrote to my counterparts \u2013 Dato\u2019 Sri Saifuddin Abdullah and Secretary Teodoro L Locsin Jr. \u2013 to express condolences and to offer any assistance they may require. The Singapore Government also contributed US$60,000 on 22 December 2021 as seed money to support the Singapore Red Cross\u2019 (SRC) public fundraising to aid disaster relief and recovery efforts in Malaysia and the Philippines. The funds raised by the SRC will focus on emergency healthcare, first aid assistance, as well as distribution of relief supplies such as hygiene kits and shelter tool kits to evacuation centres. The contribution by the Singapore Government supplemented the SRC\u2019s pledges of US$50,000 each to the Malaysian Red Crescent and the Philippine Red Cross.\nSoutheast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to natural disasters. Regional and international cooperation is important to prevent or mitigate the impact of natural disasters. For example, ASEAN Member States developed the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) to enhance our region\u2019s collective response to natural disasters. In 2021, ASEAN launched the AADMER Work Programme 2021-2025, which aims to enhance and support disaster risk reduction and management capabilities, including through inter-sectoral cooperation, capacity building, resource mobilisation, and stronger coordination among ASEAN Member States. UN agencies like the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) also work with governments and communities on disaster risk reduction and prevention, which is important to help countries build a more resilient future.\nSingapore will support such regional and international efforts where we can. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has put its humanitarian assistance and disaster relief team on standby for deployment, should there be requests for support from our ASEAN counterparts. SCDF also works closely with the United Nations OCHA Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to monitor the disaster situation in the region. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, we conduct courses on disaster management and disaster risk reduction through the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) and with international partners such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the UNDRR. For example, Singapore has partnered the UNDRR on an annual course on disaster risk reduction since 2015. We have conducted seven runs of the course for 252 participants from 82 countries and international organisations to date. Singapore will continue to work with regional and international partners to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from disasters in the future.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n14 FEBRUARY 2022"

This was Prime Minister Lee\u2019s fifth Leaders\u2019 Retreat with President Joko Widodo and the first since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Leaders affirmed the excellent relations between Singapore and Indonesia. They also agreed that significant progress had been made on bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual benefit to both countries.\nPrime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo witnessed the signing and exchange of the following set of agreements: an Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR, a Treaty for the Extradition of Fugitives (ET), a Joint Statement between the Defence Ministers on the 2007 Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and its Implementing Arrangement between the Singapore Armed Forces and the Indonesian Armed Forces (now referred to as \u201cthe Indonesian National Defence Forces\u201d) for the Military Training Area in Indonesia (IA-MTA), as well as an Exchange of Letters undertaking to bring the agreements above into force simultaneously. These bilateral agreements were negotiated on the basis of the \u2018Framework for Discussions\u2019 that the two Leaders endorsed at the Leaders\u2019 Retreat in 2019.\nUnder the FIR Agreement, Singapore and Indonesia have agreed to realign the boundary between the Jakarta FIR and the Singapore FIR. Indonesia will delegate to Singapore the provision of air navigation services in portions of the airspace within the realigned Jakarta FIR. This Agreement will remain in force for 25 years and shall be extended by mutual consent if both parties find it beneficial to do so. The FIR Agreement takes into account ICAO rules and regulations and will be submitted for approval to the ICAO in accordance with an agreed procedure.\nUnder the ET, Singapore and Indonesia will grant extradition for a comprehensive list of extraditable offences covered by the treaty, in accordance with the laws of both countries and subject to the requisite safeguards and provisions in the ET.\nThe DCA will strengthen the strategic relationship between both defence establishments, and the SAF and TNI, by enhancing cooperation and promoting closer interaction between our Armed Forces. As part of the DCA, the SAF will continue to conduct military training and exercises in training areas in Indonesia, with full respect for Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty over its territory, including its archipelagic and territorial waters and its airspace, and in accordance with UNCLOS. The DCA and IA-MTA shall remain in force for 25 years.\nThe Leaders affirmed that the conclusion of these agreements under this Framework reflects the maturity of bilateral relations and illustrates our commitment to resolving longstanding matters of mutual importance amicably and constructively, for the long-term mutual benefit of our countries and peoples. The Leaders agreed that the agreements had taken into account the rights and interests of both countries and would be durable and for the long haul.\nBoth Leaders also agreed that the agreements represented an important milestone for bilateral relations. Once ratified and simultaneously brought into force, they would pave the way for stronger and deeper bilateral cooperation, particularly in the areas of civil aviation, defence, and criminal matters. Prime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo agreed that the resolution of these longstanding matters also put both countries in good stead to further deepen engagement in mutual areas of priority.\nPrime Minister Lee also accepted President Joko Widodo\u2019s invitation to the G20 Summit in Bali later this year and expressed Singapore\u2019s support for Indonesia\u2019s G20 Presidency.\nPrime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo emphasised the importance of Singapore and Indonesia recovering together from the COVID-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo also discussed current travel arrangements, including the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) from Jakarta to Singapore and Indonesia\u2019s decision to resume tourism travel from Singapore to specific resorts in Bintan and Batam. Both sides would discuss further expansion of these arrangements, on a reciprocal basis, taking into account the COVID-19 situation.\nNoting our robust economic ties, Prime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo discussed ways to build on the success of projects such as the Kendal Industrial Park and the Nongsa Digital Park (NDP). They welcomed the launch of the Nongsa Digital Town (D-Town) in Batam as the next phase of NDP\u2019s development. The recently signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Financial and Economic Cooperation between the Singapore Ministry of Finance and Indonesian Ministry of Finance, and the MOU between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Bank Indonesia to expand cooperation across central banking, financial regulation and payments innovation would also encourage more multi-faceted and forward-looking institutional linkages in developing our digital economies.\nPrime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo looked forward to further areas of collaboration to support our common interest in the digital economy, sustainability, and the green economy. To this end, the Leaders welcomed the announcement of an MOU on Bilateral Partnership on Green and Circular Economy Development between the Singapore Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning and an MOU on Energy Cooperation between the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. These MOUs will promote new opportunities for green growth, and the development of new and emerging technologies.\nAmidst the initiatives to bolster recovery, Prime Minister Lee and President Joko Widodo concurred that the full bilateral agenda was possible due to the support of strong people-to-people ties and efforts from both sides on developing human capacity. This is an important area of cooperation that will see further expansion under the Human Capital Partnership Arrangement between the Singapore Ministry of Education and the Indonesian Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology. The arrangement would formalise regular exchanges between our educators and youth, including in the area of vocational education.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 25 JANUARY 2022\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bintan, Indonesia, on 25 January 2022 for the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders\u2019 Retreat\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bintan, Indonesia, on 25 January 2022 for the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders\u2019 Retreat\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesian President Joko Widodo with Singapore and Indonesian Ministers at the ceremony for the signing of agreements at the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders\u2019 Retreat.

        "date": "19 Jan 2022, 15:57",
        "country": "China",
        "content": "Emeritus Senior Minister (ESM) Goh Chok Tong delivered remarks virtually at the 3rd Hong Kong Forum on US-China Relations on 19 January, organised by the China-United States Exchange Foundation and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. The theme of the conference is Beyond Differences, Towards Cooperation\nThe full text is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n19 JANUARY 2022\n1 Good morning and also good evening. Thank you for inviting me to the third edition of the Hong Kong Forum on US-China Relations. The world has changed beyond recognition since I last spoke at the inaugural Forum in 2019. What remains unchanged is the global strategic importance of US-China relationship. Let me first speak on how I see the problem, before suggesting how best to move forward.\n2. If trust is the currency of the realm, then the main deficit in the geopolitical ledger is the mutual strategic distrust between the US and China. It stems from a difference in values, ideologies, worldviews, political systems, and perspectives on global governance. If this distrust cannot be overcome, the world will be condemned like Sisyphus to roll the boulder of a contentious US-China relationship up a hill for eternity.\n3. The US has assessed that China is, in President Biden\u2019s words, \u201cdeadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world\u201d. It views China as its main strategic competitor and a threat to American national security and values. The US has therefore bolstered its military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific, and strengthened its alliances and partnerships through platforms like the Quad and AUKUS. It has also drawn attention to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as to what it views as China\u2019s coercive behaviour in other parts of the world. From Washington\u2019s perspective, China is not following the established rules of the global order despite being a chief beneficiary. Instead, China is seeking to rewrite these rules in its favour.\n4. At best, China sees this as a US containment strategy to prevent its rise as a global power. At worst, it sees this as a long-term strategy to weaken China and break it up. It sees the US\u2019 framing of \u201cdemocracy versus autocracy\u201d as a move to undermine China\u2019s political system and the dominance of the CPC. A similar ideological battle brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n5. The Chinese leadership takes the view that foreign powers managed to exploit China in the past because it was not strong enough. Till today, Chinese leaders frequently remind its people of China\u2019s Century of Humiliation, including on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC. Hence, China is building up multiple defensive and offensive capabilities \u2013 at sea, in the air, out at space, and through cyber warfare. The ultimate weapon will be nuclear. The threat of mutually assured destruction is the best deterrence.\n6. China reasons that these capabilities are needed to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. But to the US, China\u2019s military build-up harbours offensive intent, particularly as it sees Beijing to be reluctant to engage in global discussions on managing the build-up of nuclear capabilities. To China, the US should instead scale down its immensely superior nuclear capabilities.\n7. At their recent virtual summit, President Biden called for \u201ccommon-sense guardrails\u201d, while President Xi compared the two countries to two giant ships that must forge ahead together without colliding. Actions on the ground should reflect the two leaders\u2019 words. The US and China must see that it is in their own interests to maintain a stable and peaceful international environment. Both countries need to implement \u201ctrust but verify\u201d agreements as they try to resolve outstanding bilateral issues while attaining their geopolitical ambitions.\n8 What now? Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that the US\u2019 approach to China will be \u201ccompetitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be\u201d. Building on this frame, I suggest that the US and China should \u201cAvoid Conflict over Differences, Embrace Healthy Competition, and Maximise Cooperation\u201d.\n9. My biggest concern is whether Taiwan becomes a casus belli. I do not think the Mainland wants to invade Taiwan and reunify it through force. However, if it sees no prospect for peaceful reunification, it may believe it has no choice.\n10. Beijing has reiterated on countless occasions that Taiwanese independence is its redline. But the big unknown is what is the tipping point that would force the Mainland to act. The more international space Taiwan gains, which Beijing sees as the result of tacit encouragement from the US, the more the Mainland will ratchet up pressure on Taiwan.\n11. The US and China should negotiate guardrails to avert conflict over Taiwan. It is better to create the 21st-century equivalent of the \u201cRed Telephone\u201d than risk spiralling escalation and military conflict through miscalculation.\n12. Beyond merely avoiding conflict, the US-China relationship should be underpinned by healthy competition and driven by cooperation where possible. President Xi has said that \"We should advocate fair competition, like competing with each other for excellence in a racing field, not beating each other on a wrestling arena\". President Biden has also said that the US would \u201cinsist that China play by the international rules of fair competition, fair practices and fair trade\u201d. Taken at face value, there is common ground to work together.\n13. The US and China will have to address what exactly healthy competition will look like, in accordance with international law and the existing international rules-based order. There are many pressing global issues that require both the US and China to cooperate closely as global powers. Free trade, climate change, global pandemic preparedness, and religious extremism, are a few of them.\n14. Besides the two protagonists, what can the rest of us do? I have been speaking about the Voice of Moderation since 2019. This Voice represents the concerned countries, leaders, institutions, media, business, think-tanks and people who want to avert a catastrophic clash between the US and China. It advocates strategic rationality, peace, growth and prosperity within an interdependent, open, inclusive, rules-based multilateral order. The Moderate Voice must urge the US and China to play a \u201cpositive-sum game\u201d, not a zero-sum game, and certainly not a negative-sum game. All countries in the world want a positive and constructive relationship with both the US and China.\n15. Peace through acceptance of differences is a practical way forward. ASEAN is a prime example of how countries with very different geographies, histories, languages, and political systems came together to share a common vision of a peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia.\n16. ASEAN can be a substantive Voice of Moderation. We have consistently encouraged both the US and China to remain productively engaged in the region across different sectors. Both countries are Dialogue Partners of ASEAN and we hope to continue engaging both China and the US at ASEAN meetings at the highest level.\n17. Your forum, too, is a meaningful Voice of Moderation. I hope that when CUSEF and CCIEE convene the next forum, both major powers would have made good headway in managing their mutual strategic distrust. Doing so will require wisdom and statecraft of the highest order. I believe both Presidents Biden and Xi possess these qualities. I pray that they will be able to build up strategic trust between their countries and peoples.\n18 Thank you."

Prime Minister Lee reaffirmed Singapore\u2019s support for Cambodia\u2019s ASEAN Chairmanship and thanked Prime Minister Hun Sen for the briefing on his recent visit to Myanmar.\nPrime Minister Lee noted that there had not been any significant progress in the implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus since its adoption on 24 April 2021 at a meeting at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta between ASEAN Leaders and Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Prime Minister Lee expressed his view that until there was significant progress in implementing the Five-Point Consensus, ASEAN should maintain its decision reached at the 38th and 39thASEAN Summits of inviting a non-political representative from Myanmar to ASEAN meetings. Any discussion to revise the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 decision had to be based on new facts. Prime Minister Lee emphasised the need for the ASEAN Chair to engage all parties concerned, including the Tatmadaw and the National League for Democracy (NLD). The Tatmadaw had proposed a ceasefire with Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) only but the call for a cessation of violence in the Five-Point Consensus referredalso, and indeed primarily, to violence against the Tatmadaw\u2019s political opponents and civilians. Prime Minister Lee noted that just days after Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s visit, there had been further attacks by the Tatmadaw against its political opponents, and additional prison sentences imposed on State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.\nPrime Minister Hun Sen made some proposals on how to coordinate a ceasefire in Myanmar and deliver humanitarian assistance to the Myanmar people. Prime Minister Lee said that he was unsure what role ASEAN or the ASEAN Chair\u2019s Special Envoy on Myanmar could play in coordinating a ceasefire since we did not even have access to all parties. However, Singapore had no in-principle objections to such a mechanism if it could foster an end to violence. Prime Minister Lee said that there was a need for progress in the delivery of humanitarian assistance with the involvement of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) and with the cooperation of the Tatmadaw. Prime Minister Lee agreed that these proposals raised by the ASEAN Chair should be further discussed among the ASEAN Foreign Ministers and Senior Officials.\nPrime Minister Lee hoped that Cambodia would consider his views and those of other ASEAN Leaders. He reaffirmed Singapore\u2019s commitment to work with Cambodia and other ASEAN Member States on the full implementation of ASEAN\u2019s Five-Point Consensus and relevant ASEAN decisions.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n15 JANUARY 2022"

MOH Chief Health Scientist, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, is Singapore\u2019s representative on the COVAX Shareholders\u2019 Council. Until the end of 2021, he also served as one of three Council representatives on the COVAX Market Sensitive Decisions Committee, which reviews proposed agreements with vaccine manufacturers to ensure reasonableness, acceptable level of reputation risks, and availability of resources. We are a member of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Facilitation Council, in our capacity as Chair of the Forum of Small States, where we have worked to ensure that the perspectives of small States are taken into account.\n3 Members would also be aware of the Singapore Government\u2019s contributions of vaccines to countries in our region in their times of need. In July 2021, PM Lee announced that Singapore would donate our vaccine allocation under the COVAX initiative to other countries. PM further announced in October 2021 that Singapore had contributed our allocation of vaccines under the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund to other ASEAN Member States. We have shared vaccines, procured under the COVAX initiative, with our neighbours, including 122,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the Riau Islands province, and we have plans to further donate vaccine doses to neighbouring countries. In addition to donating vaccines under the COVAX initiative, we have provided 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei; 20,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, and 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Johor. We also entered into mutually beneficial dose sharing arrangements with Australia, Thailand and Brunei, where we sent 500,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Australia, 122,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Thailand and 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei in September 2021. So far, we have received the same number of doses back from Australia to support our booster programme.\n4 We have contributed in other ways beyond the supply of vaccines. For example, the Singapore Government sent more than 500 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indonesia through our \u201cOxygen Shuttle\u201d Programme and donated 200,000 diagnostic tests and 500,000 nasopharyngeal swabs to Thailand, as well as 200,000 Antigen Rapid Tests to Vietnam. We worked with the Singapore Red Cross to distribute 200 oxygen concentrators to affected communities in Myanmar, and contributed USD 100,000 through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) to the people of Myanmar when they faced a surge in COVID-19 cases. A Singapore nominee, former SCDF Assistant Commissioner Lee Yam Ming, has been elected and is serving as the Executive Director of the AHA Centre since August 2021. Under his leadership, the AHA Centre has already facilitated the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of Myanmar. In addition to assisting fellow ASEAN countries, we airlifted a consignment of 256 urgently needed oxygen cylinders to India, and contributed medical supplies to fellow small island States such as Fiji and Palau. We continue to share best practices and information on the virus, including sharing the source code of TraceTogether publicly, which has helped several countries develop their own contact tracing applications.\n5 During the pandemic, we remained committed to maintaining our openness as a major logistics, transportation, and energy hub. Our air and sea ports remain open to minimise global supply disruptions and ensure the uninterrupted flow of critical supplies such as vaccines, medicines and food, which not only benefitted Singapore but other countries as well. We also did not prohibit the export or transhipment of any goods through Singapore, including medical supplies in high demand like N-95 respirators. Changi Airport\u2019s continued operation has helped to facilitate the repatriation of many Singaporeans and students, and enabled thousands of passengers to return home using Singapore as a transit point. Our efforts to keep our air and sea ports open despite COVID-19 will prevent the loss of strategic capabilities and our hard-earned position as a reliable transport hub. As a global maritime hub, we have also helped to vaccinate port workers and ship crew. Such moves have helped the countries in the region and beyond not only procure essential supplies during the pandemic but ensured that we can all make a smoother recovery from it.\n6 The above is just a snapshot of the assistance and support Singapore has rendered to our friends and partners during this critical and challenging period. Singapore remains fully committed to support the global fight against COVID-19. The WHO Director General has called for 2022 to be the year when we end the acute stage of the pandemic. Singapore will work towards this goal by controlling the pandemic at home, and with our partners and international organisations to strengthen the global health architecture and build pandemic preparedness and resilience. We are working with the WHO and relevant partners, including through our Executive Board membership, to strengthen urban health emergency preparedness. This includes taking into account pandemic control in urban development, ensuring social support, the continuity of education, and synergising finance and health needs.\n7 It might be tempting in these times, especially with the spread of the Omicron variant, to turn inwards, but we must never forget that Singapore\u2019s continued prosperity is dependent on our ability to maintain our openness and relevance to the international community. I am proud that we have not shied away from contributing, within our means, to the global fight against the pandemic. Many Singapore-based private sector entities and other civil society organisations have also played their part, and I would like to thank them for flying our flag high. We will continue to work with ASEAN and the international community, including through our work in WHO workstreams such as the Working Group on Pandemic Preparedness and Response, to ensure that the global health architecture is fit for purpose and future ready. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic that the world will face, and we must be ready to face future crises and pandemics when they arise. Singapore will continue to do our part to help make sure that this remains so.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n10 JANUARY 2022"

They reaffirmed the excellent ties between Singapore and China, and welcomed the good progress made in bilateral cooperation despite the COVID-19 pandemic, including in traditional areas of cooperation ranging from trade and investment to financial cooperation.\nWith the pandemic accelerating existing structural shifts, DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed to explore new areas of collaboration, in particular in digital economy and green development. DPM Heng also highlighted the importance of restoring connectivity for post-pandemic economic recovery, as well as resuming regular people-to-people exchanges, including by our businesses and students. DPM Heng noted that the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), together with Singapore Airlines, were working with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), to ensure smooth charter flight operations for the Beijing Winter Olympics which China would host in February 2022. Such cooperation demonstrated the value of working together to facilitate safe cross-border travel. Vice Premier Han expressed support for the safe resumption of cross-border travel between Singapore and China, and for officials on both sides to intensify discussions on this front.\nDPM Heng and Vice Premier Han reiterated their commitment to free and open trade, and looked forward to the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) next month, which will further deepen regional economic integration.

The cub was born on 14 August 2021 to Kai Kai and Jia Jia \u2013 the pair of Giant Pandas which arrived in Singapore in 2012 as part of a collaboration between Wildlife Reserves Singapore and the China Wildlife Conservation Association on conservation and research.\nThe 22nd SIP JSC meeting noted that the SIP was in its third decade of collaboration, and highlighted the importance of continuing to reorient the SIP\u2019s pathfinder role in Singapore-China collaboration, taking into account our shared interests. Both sides looked forward to enabling greater two-way cross-border services and investments by supporting Chinese companies\u2019 internationalisation efforts and Singapore professional services firms\u2019 expansion into China. Both sides noted the scope to deepen biomedical cooperation through the SIP and committed to strengthen people-to-people ties via two-way software exchanges.\nThe 13th SSTEC JSC meeting commended the Tianjin Eco-City (Eco-City) for its continued achievements as a leading demonstration of green and smart development in China. The Eco-City was a pathfinder, setting standards in areas including zero waste management and the use of technology to lower carbon emissions as well as enhance public amenities and services for residents. Both sides would strengthen cooperation, aim higher and elevate the Eco-City\u2019s high quality development in support of China\u2019s national environmental and development objectives. This would be done, for example, by pushing boundaries to further enhance the integration of nature with the built environment as a \u201cGarden City\u201d, and nurture community stewardship of the Eco-City\u2019s natural environment. The meeting also highlighted the joint efforts by both sides in the replication promotion efforts and sharing the Eco-City\u2019s experience with other cities in China and internationally.\nThe 5th CCI JSC meeting reaffirmed the CCI\u2019s role connecting Singapore and Chongqing as mutual hubs in our respective regions, and its complementarity with China\u2019s latest development strategies. Both sides noted the good progress made in the four priority areas of collaboration (financial services, aviation, transport and logistics, and information and communications technology) as well as the opportunities for collaboration arising from synergies across these areas.

        "content": "Singapore\u2019s Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs, Mr Sam Tan, delivered the closing remarks at the Russia-Singapore Arctic Dialogue held on 17 December 2021.\nThe dialogue, held in hybrid format and titled\u201cThe Arctic as a Global Transport Corridor: Sustainable Arctic Shipping\u201d, is jointly organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) and the Moscow School of Management (SKOLKOVO), with support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Singapore. With the increasing importance of sustainable development in the Arctic, and the Arctic emerging as a global transport corridor, the webinar focused on topics such as technology and innovation for sustainable Arctic shipping, economic development, and potential cooperation between Russian and Singaporean companies and research institutes in sustainable Arctic shipping projects.\nIn his closing remarks, Special Envoy Tan stressed the importance of driving the economic development of the Arctic while putting in place sustainable solutions in the context of climate challenges, such as through the development of technology and innovation for sustainable shipping. He also welcomed and expressed Singapore\u2019s support for the Russian Arctic Council Chairmanship\u2019s focus of a \u201cResponsible Governance for Sustainable Arctic\u201d, which is relevant not just to the Arctic, but also globally, especially as the world takes steps to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a low-lying coastal state, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels. The Arctic is a barometer of climate change, and it is in Singapore\u2019s interest to work closely with our international partners to find ways to mitigate its adverse effects. We do so by participating in international Arctic events, raising regional awareness of Arctic issues, and contributing to discussions at the Arctic Council, the leading intergovernmental forum for discussing political, economic, environmental and scientific issues concerning the governments and inhabitants of the Arctic region.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n17 DECEMBER 2021\nCLOSING REMARKS BY\nSPECIAL ENVOY FOR ARCTIC AFFAIRS SAM TAN\nAT THE RUSSIA-SINGAPORE ARCTIC DIALOGUE\nFRIDAY, 17 DECEMBER 2021\nAmbassador Korchunov,\nAmbassador Ong Keng Yong, Executive Deputy Chairman, RSIS,\nMr Andrey Sharonov, President of Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO,\nDistinguished panellists,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nI would like to extend my thanks to the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO for co-organising this webinar, and also to the panellists for the excellent and engaging discussions. Even though Singapore is situated close to 12,000 km away from the Arctic, the effects of climate change there, in particular the melting of polar ice-caps, pose a threat not just to the immediate surrounding region, but to low lying islands such as Singapore. As a small maritime nation situated at one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, Singapore is keeping a close watch on the possibilities and opportunities that the opening of the Northern Sea Route presents for international shipping.\nIn 2016, I had the privilege to sail from Anadyr to Pevekon Russia\u2019s nuclear-powered icebreaker \u201c50 Years of Victory\u201d, then the world\u2019s largest but now surpassed by its own Arktika. It allowed me to witness first-hand the rapid development and the opportunities in the Russian Arctic. The opening of new Arctic water channels, such as the Northern Sea Route, could significantly reduce shipping travel time between Asia and Europe, and potentially boost the maritime industry, although the full cost of commercial transportation in the new shipping lanes is still not fully known. A new shipping route could also complement Singapore, which has one of the world\u2019s busiest ports, receiving about 120,000 vessels each year. This translates to 300 ships every day and 12 ships every hour. As a seafaring nation, our marine industry has developed decades of experience and strong credentials in shipbuilding and repair, offshore engineering, port operation and marine support services. Singapore can further contribute to the development of maritime infrastructure to help facilitate safe shipping in the Arctic region. In fact, several shipping companies from Singapore such as Keppel Offshore & Marine develop icebreakers and offshore rigs that operate in the Arctic, while ST Marine and SembCorp have the required competency to construct ice-class vessels. Keppel was also the very first Asian shipyard to build icebreakers.\nAs mentioned by distinguished panellists, the economic development of the Arctic must go hand in hand with sustainable solutions in the context of climate challenges, as well as the development of technology and innovation for sustainable shipping. Sustainable development is one important area that requires collaboration from all stakeholders, which we have emphasised in the recently launched Singapore Green Plan 2030. In this regard, Singapore welcomes and fully supports the Russian Arctic Council Chairmanship\u2019s theme of a \u201cResponsible Governance for Sustainable Arctic\u201d. The key areas of focus \u2013people, environmental protection, and socioeconomic development \u2013 are important not just to the Arctic, but also globally, especially as we take steps to emerge from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSingapore looks forward to closely working with the Russian Chair to contribute meaningfully to the work of the Council, including supporting the work of sustainable development of the Arctic and environmental issues such as marine litter and green shipping.\nThank you for your kind attention.\nCaption: Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Sam Tan delivering the closing remarks for the Russia-Singapore Arctic Dialogue.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nCaption: Special Envoy Sam Tan interacting with panellists and participants of the Russia-Singapore Arctic Dialogue."

Through four consecutive terms in the Federal Chancellery, you steered Germany, and Europe, through many highs and lows. You have earned the respect of your peers in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world.\nI am glad we met again recently at the G20 meeting a few weeks ago. As you reminded me in Rome, the first time we met was in December 2005 in Berlin. I had taken over as Prime Minister the year before, and it was my good fortune to be your first official guest shortly after you were sworn in as Chancellor. Since then, we have met regularly, including during your Official Visit to Singapore in 2011, when an orchid was named after you; and on my two subsequent visits to Berlin. Our exchanges were always constructive and substantial, and I have greatly valued your candour and methodical approach to the complex issues confronting our countries and the world.\nIt has been my privilege to work with you to strengthen the excellent relations between our two countries. The Joint Declaration on Enhanced Partnership, first signed by our predecessors in 1998, was upgraded in 2005. Our bilateral collaboration has grown, particularly in the areas of defence, education, scientific research, and Industry 4.0. I am especially grateful for your strong support for the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which has brought tangible benefits to companies in Singapore and the EU, including Germany. Germany is one of Singapore\u2019s key economic partners and many more German companies are investing in Singapore, including BioNTech which is building a vaccine plant here.\nGermany\u2019s international stature today as a reliable and responsible power would not have been possible without your wise leadership and commitment to fostering strong international partnerships through a rules-based multilateral system. You have inspired many young men and women through your exemplary leadership and service to both your nation and the international community.\nHo Ching and I wish you and Joachim the very best of health and much fulfilment in your retirement. As I said to you in Rome, both of you will always be welcomed as our guests in Singapore.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHer Excellency Dr Angela Merkel\nFederal Chancellor\nFederal Republic of Germany\n8 December 2021\nDear Chancellor Scholz,\nI was happy to meet you in Rome during the recent G20 Summit. Please accept my warmest congratulations on your electoral victory, and appointment as Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nGermany is an important and trusted partner for Singapore. Over the years, our bilateral ties have strengthened through numerous exchanges at all levels. I recall your last visit to Singapore for the World Cities Summit in July 2016 while you were First Mayor of Hamburg. A year later, in July 2017, I had the pleasure of visiting Hamburg for the G20 Summit. I am glad that our bilateral ties have continued to deepen, underpinned by robust cooperation spanning the diplomatic, defence, economic, education, environment, research, and cultural sectors. Reflecting the enduring friendship between our two countries, Germany was one of the first countries with which Singapore launched a Vaccinated Travel Lane. This was a key step towards re-establishing air connectivity for vaccinated individuals amidst the pandemic.\nRegionally, there is much scope for Singapore and Germany to serve as each other\u2019s hubs in our respective regions, especially given our shared support for multilateralism, free trade, and a rules-based global order. We can also work together to strengthen ties between Europe and Southeast Asia, including under the auspices of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the ASEAN-EU Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement. Given the many global challenges that we face, including the pandemic, climate change, and the impact these have had on our supply chains and livelihoods, it is timely that our two countries are looking to broaden cooperation in new areas such as the digital economy, cybersecurity, and sustainability. I look forward to working closely with you on these and other issues, both bilaterally and at the various multilateral fora which our countries take part in.\nI wish you and your government every success in the years ahead, and all the very best as Germany takes on the G7 Presidency next year.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Olaf Scholz\nFederal Chancellor\nFederal Republic of Germany"

I wish we could meet in person. It has been some time, but at least we still get to interact virtually. Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the Government of the UAE (United Arab Emirates), of course, the India Foundation, and the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies for organising what is now the fifth Indian Ocean Conference. I recall that Singapore hosted the inaugural conference in 2016, and it is an honour to participate again as one of the Co-Vice Chairs.\nExcellencies, the Indian Ocean has been an essential conduit for trade, culture, religion, language and geostrategic influence over the past five to six centuries. Thus, the theme for today, \u201cEcology, Economy, and Epidemic\u201d is very salient. COVID-19 has accelerated, in fact, many pre-existing trends, and these include nativism, nationalism, (and) anti-globalisation. The virus, in a very real way, transcends borders, race, language, religion. Even today, as we deal with the emergence of the new Omicron variant, (which) perfectly illustrates this point, no one is safe until everyone is safe. We have to contribute to the collective fight against COVID-19, wherever and however we can.\nSingapore developed the TraceTogether app for contact-tracing. In the early stages of the pandemic, I recall, we had received many requests to replicate similar systems. We decided we would make its source code open, and we called it OpenTrace. We made it freely available. We enabled others to adapt it to their own needs. We also published the BlueTrace protocol to promote interoperability across jurisdictions.\nSingapore has also been an early advocate for vaccine multilateralism, a term coined by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. We co-chair the Friends of the COVAX Facility alongside Switzerland to support its work. Singapore also contributed US$5 million to the Advanced Market Commitment mechanism, as well as our entire vaccine allotment under COVAX to our partners.\nMeanwhile, climate change is an existential threat with developing countries being especially vulnerable. The Indian Ocean is warming up at a rate that is estimated to be three times higher than the Pacific, and these rising sea levels will contribute to extreme weather events, including more frequent floods in low lying areas, and severe coastal erosion. The multitude of flora and fauna that depend on our ocean will also be affected. By this century\u2019s end, Singapore expects to experience more frequent and intense rainfalls, (and) a rise of sea-levels up to one metre, which will really place us at the upper bound of the global estimates.\nThe recent 26thConference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-26) underscored the importance of a multilateral rules-based response. I was very heartened to hear countries raise their climate ambitions. It is also encouraging that the developed countries have committed to enhancing finance to help developing countries strengthen their resilience, and to achieve their climate pledges. Singapore will continue to support these multilateral frameworks, and we will be a constructive, fair and honest broker.\nDespite Singapore's constraints as an alternative energy disadvantaged country, Singapore will continue to escalate our own domestic climate efforts. We have announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is a \u201cWhole-of-Nation\u201d roadmap to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and our own net zero aspiration. We aim to quadruple solar energy production by 2025, to decarbonise our energy grids through electricity imports, and to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040, while actively investing in low carbon solutions.\nBeyond our domestic efforts, Singapore is committed to helping fellow developing countries implement our climate pledges, through our Climate Action Package, which was launched in 2018 under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. We offer courses in areas such as climate science, climate mitigation, adaptation strategies, flood management, green finance, and disaster risk reduction.\nLet me now turn to the economy. As we focus on a post-pandemic economic recovery, we need to remain clear-eyed about the downside risks. The trajectory of COVID-19 is still uncertain, and the effects of waning immunity, or the ongoing evolving mutations such as the recent Omicron variant, remain to be seen. Meanwhile, global supply chain disruptions, coupled with a pick-up in demand and rising energy prices could spur inflation. The economic stimuli and the government support have provided much-needed short term relief, but will also have long term implications on governments\u2019 sovereign debt.\nIt is thus important for us to enhance cooperation to promote supply chain resilience. We used to organise supply chains on the basis of \u201cjust in time\u201d, but I think we need to replace this with a concept called \u201cjust in case\u201d. Free trade remains crucial for sustained recovery. We continue to strongly support free trade agreements such as the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership), as well as the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). These are inclusive, open agreements, and the door remains open for others to join the RCEP. Singapore also welcomes economies that are able and willing to meet the high standards of the CPTPP.\nCOVID-19 has turbocharged the digital transformation in all our countries, but we need to enhance multilateral cooperation, in order to leverage these digital technologies to support and to achieve sustainable development, and to close the digital divide. We are also looking into digital and green economy regional agreements.\nFor Singapore, we have embarked on the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN). We welcome our dialogue partners present today to collaborate with us on this endeavour.\nThe nexus between the economy and ecology is now very, very clear. For countries in the Indian Ocean region, travel, tourism, maritime transport, fisheries and seafood production are key drivers of economic growth and recovery. A sustainable blue economy will support the UN\u2019s (United Nations) SDG 14 (Sustainable Development Goal 14) on the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources, and the global goals on poverty, jobs, resilient communities, and climate change.\nWe need innovative financial instruments, including blue bonds, debt-for-nature, CSR investment and blended financing. We should also foster collaboration between communities, businesses and finance towards high standards of transparency. Ultimately, sustainability and accountability go hand in hand \u2013 they are based on the same value systems.\nLadies and gentlemen, a key factor in regional peace and prosperity is our ability to cooperate under a rules-based international order. Many people have been disenchanted by the multilateral institutions and the processes that have in fact upheld the post-World War II global order. But we must resist the temptation to become populist or inward-looking, in order to gain short-term political dividends, because if we do so we will burden future generations and set us all on a trajectory that is inimical to our own enlightened long-term interests. We make the argument that an open, inclusive, rules-based multilateral world order is not merely a preference or an ideology \u2013 it is a necessity. Especially for small trading city states, like Singapore, where our trade is three times our GDP, it is an existential imperative to keep the Indian Ocean open and peaceful. Even in competition, a rules-based international order will set boundaries and will allow for amicable dispute resolution.\nIt is in this context, we welcome the US and China\u2019s statements to work together to deepen cooperation and to prevent conflict. We hope the major powers will find amodus vivendithat will enable cooperation in areas of common interest, like climate change and free trade.\nIn addition, frameworks, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), are absolutely key to a stable and inclusive region. The 40thanniversary of the adoption of UNCLOS next year will be an opportunity for all parties to reaffirm our commitment to UNCLOS as the primary legal instrument for oceans governance.\nLadies and gentlemen, this pandemic will not be the last global crisis. While COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll, it also presents an opportunity for us to re-learn the importance of banding together and finding collective solutions. As fellow countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change, and reliant on trade for our economic well-being, we are all here at this conference because we have a shared vision of an Indian Ocean built on peace, security, stability and prosperity.\nI look forward to a constructive dialogue with the goal of finding solutions that combine the diversity of our strengths, and look forward to your questions.\nThank you all very much.\nVideo caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering his remarks virtually at the 5th Indian Ocean Conference.\nVideo credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Next year, our two countries will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations.\n4 Beyond political interactions, a key focus of our relationship is economic collaboration. Many Singapore companies have invested in Bangladesh, especially in the energy, agri-processing, and infrastructure sectors.\n5 Bangladesh is well-positioned to be a gateway between South Asia and Southeast Asia. Singapore\u2019s PSA International has been working closely with the Chittagong Port Authority and other partners on the Bay Terminal Project at Chittagong. This container terminal, when implemented, will enable Bangladesh to capitalise on its favourable geographical location. It will increase the flow of goods through Bangladesh.\n6 Today, I would like to highlight three global issues that relate to the theme of \u201cAdvancing Peace through Social Inclusion\u201d.\n7 First, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not just a global health crisis which has disrupted our economy and lives. It is also a severe stress test of global cooperation, national governance and the resilience of our economies and societies.\n8 The pandemic has had the greatest impact on the vulnerable. They find it more difficult to cope with health and economic challenges than those who are better resourced. They need to be helped and supported, i.e. socially included. Countries may differ in their societal make-up, whether in terms of ethnicity, religion, language, or politics. But the underlying mission of all governments must be the same \u2013 inclusive progress. The fruits of economic growth must be shared equitably. To reduce income inequality and political discontent, we must improve social mobility. This applies not just within countries but also between countries. To advance world peace, there must be multilateral cooperation to generate and spread growth. Otherwise, economic migrants from poorer countries will flow unabated to richer countries.\n9 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply chain of critical products. Many countries are onshoring the production of these products for national security reasons and subsidising these industries heavily. This reconfiguration of supply chains and trade patterns will have a further adverse impact on emerging economies.\n10 The second global challenge is climate change. It is an existential threat for mankind. Low-lying countries like Singapore and Bangladesh are particularly vulnerable. Rising sea levels and changing weather patterns will disrupt our lives and livelihoods. As is the case with COVID-19, the most vulnerable countries and the most vulnerable within countries will suffer disproportionately.\n11 It is critical to maintain the momentum from the recently concluded COP 26 and turn pledges into action. Green energy is more expensive, at least in the foreseeable future. But we must remain firm in our commitment to transition to clean energy. Here, Singapore companies have collaborated with Bangladesh to build and operate a 50-megawatt solar power plant in Mymensingh, about 100km north of Dhaka.\n12 The third global issue that stands in the way of world peace is also the one that I am most worried about. COVID-19 and climate change are exogenous events. But geo-political power rivalry is endogenous in global governance. It is also a fact of life since time immemorial. The US-China relationship defines the policy space for all national governments to operate in an interconnected global economy. Unfortunately, there is a trust deficit between them. The US is ideological on advancing democracy and championing human rights outside their own country. China sees this as an American strategy to contain its growth. They are distrustful of each other\u2019s long-term intentions. The more China grows, the narrower the economic, technological, and military gap between China and the US will become. The narrower the gap is, the more the US will take actions and rally allies to deal with real or perceived threats posed by a superpower China. Any clash between these two superpowers will be disastrous, particularly for Asia. It will derail Asia\u2019s efforts to achieve peace and prosperity for its people.\n13 Are we helpless bystanders? No. We can be the voice of reason, the voice of moderation. We must reinvigorate multilateral and regional collaboration in pursuit of shared peace and prosperity. Let us voice out our desire and support for a stable, rules-based multilateral world order. Here Singapore and Bangladesh share common principles and positions. We collaborate well at international and regional fora. Bangladesh is a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum. Singapore welcomes your interest in becoming a Sectoral Dialogue Partner of ASEAN. We are members of the Asia-Europe Meeting. Singapore also welcomes Bangladesh\u2019s Chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Rim Association, which Singapore is a member of.\n14 We can be the voice of cooperation and peace. We can let the superpowers know where we stand, and the peace, prosperity and social inclusion we seek. Hence, Singapore\u2019s support for the World Peace Conference.\n15 Thank you."

        "content": "1 The Global Governance Group (3G)[1]welcomes the outcome of the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit held in Rome, Italy, from 30 to 31 October 2021. The 3G notes that the G20 had agreed to further strengthen its common response to the pandemic to pave the way for a global recovery, combat climate change, further advance efforts to ensure that the benefits of digitalisation are shared broadly and to reduce inequalities in this area.\n2 The 3G further notes the assessment by the G20 that economic recovery remains highly divergent across and within countries due to the possible spread of new variants of COVID-19 and uneven vaccination paces. The 3G thus welcomes the G20\u2019s determination to use all available tools for as long as required to address the adverse consequences of the pandemic, especially on those most impacted. The 3G further supports G20\u2019s affirmation of the importance of an open, fair, equitable, sustainable, non-discriminatory and inclusive rules-based multilateral trade system in restoring growth, job creation and industrial productivity and promoting sustainable development. The 3G also welcomes the G20\u2019s commitment to strengthen the multilateral trade system with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core.\n3 The 3G appreciates the G20\u2019s decision to advance its efforts to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, with particular regard to the needs of low- and middle-income countries. We note that the G20 will reinforce global strategies to support vaccine research, development, production and distribution, including by strengthening supply chains and by expanding and diversifying global vaccine manufacturing capacity. The 3G welcomes the G20\u2019s commitments to refrain from WTO-inconsistent export restrictions and to increase transparency and predictability in vaccine delivery. We appreciate the G20\u2019s support to strengthen the leading and coordination role of an adequately and sustainably funded World Health Organization (WHO), and noted the establishment of a G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force aimed at enhancing dialogue and global cooperation on issues relating to pandemicprevention, preparedness and response (PPR); promoting the exchange of experiences and best practices; developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, including to address potential financing gaps; promoting collective action; assessing and addressing health emergencies with cross-border impact; and encouraging effective stewardship of resources for pandemic PPR, while adopting a One Health approach.\n4 The 3G notes that the G20 remained deeply concerned about the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, especially in developing countries, which has set back progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We welcome the G20\u2019s reaffirmation of its commitment to a global response to accelerate progress on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and to support a sustainable, inclusive and resilient recovery across the world. We further welcome the G20\u2019s commitment to achieving food security and adequate nutrition for all.\n5 The 3G appreciates the G20\u2019s commitment to tackle the critical and urgent threat of climate change through the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. As impacts of climate change are experienced more acutely by small- and medium-sized nations, the 3G reiterates the importance of accelerating international cooperation and stands ready to work with the G20 to address this pressing challenge.\n6 The 3G appreciates Italy\u2019s active outreach to 3G members during its 2021 G20 Presidency and looks forward to continuing our constructive discussion with the Indonesian Presidency in 2022. The 3G reiterates that the United Nations is the only global body with universal participation and clear legitimacy and calls on the G20 to implement actions that complement and strengthen the UN system.\n30 NOVEMBER 2021\n[1] The Global Governance Group (3G) comprises thefollowing Member States of the United Nations: Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, San Marino, Senegal, Singapore, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam."

Prime Minister Ismail Sabri was accompanied by Malaysian Senior Minister of International Trade and Industry Dato\u2019 Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Saifuddin Abdullah, Malaysian Minister of Transport Datuk Seri Ir. Dr. Wee Ka Siong, Menteri Besar of Johor Dato\u2019 Hasni Mohammad, and senior officials.\nFollowing an Official Welcome Ceremony, a new orchid hybrid, the DendrobiumIsmail Sabri Yaakob was named in Prime Minister Ismail Sabri\u2019s honour. A factsheet on the orchid is at Appendix. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri made a courtesy call on President Halimah Yacob, and met Prime Minister Lee. The two Prime Ministers also held a Joint Press Conference before adjourning for an Official Lunch hosted by Prime Minister Lee.\nPresident Halimah congratulated Prime Minister Ismail Sabri on his appointment, and underscored the need for Singapore and Malaysia to continue to build on their deep-rooted ties of kinship, culture and history.\nDuring their meeting, Prime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Ismail Sabri affirmed the longstanding bilateral relations and close people-to-people ties that Singapore and Malaysia have forged over decades of mutual trust and cooperation. They noted with satisfaction that both sides have cooperated closely during the COVID-19 pandemic, including establishing the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) for official and business travel, the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) for workers, and facilitating compassionate travel via the Death and Critical Illness Emergency Visits (DCEV) scheme. Singapore and Malaysia have also worked closely together to ensure that supply chains were unaffected throughout the pandemic.\nWith the good progress made by both countries in bringing the COVID-19 situation under control, Prime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Ismail Sabri welcomed the timely launch of the Singapore-Malaysia Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL) on 29 November 2021 for travel by air and across the Causeway. The VTLs will reunite families and loved ones who were separated during the pandemic. They will also play a vital role in restoring Singapore and Malaysia\u2019s bilateral and regional connectivity, as both countries adapt to COVID-19 endemicity. Both sides agreed to work towards gradually scaling up the capacity of the VTLs, and including more types of travellers from around mid-December 2021, taking into account the public health situation. Singapore and Malaysia will also work towards a VTL (Sea), and resuming port calls by cruise ships from Singapore to Malaysia.\nPrime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Ismail Sabri also discussed other opportunities for collaboration that would be mutually beneficial to both peoples and economies in the longer term. This included the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link Project, which would enhance connectivity by providing a faster and more convenient option for travellers to commute between Singapore and Johor Bahru.\nPrime Minister Ismail Sabri also accepted Prime Minister Lee\u2019s invitation to visit Singapore again for an in-person Leaders\u2019 Retreat in the first quarter of 2022.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n29 NOVEMBER 2021\nAppendix\nFACTSHEET\nDendrobium Ismail Sabri Yaakob\nDendrobiumSingapore Blue Antlerx DendrobiumSinga Friendship\nThis is a robust and free-flowering orchid hybrid.

        "content": "Let me first congratulate Bangladesh for assuming the Chairmanship of IORA for the next two years. Under your Chairmanship, I have every confidence that IORA will continue to grow as an organisation and achieve new heights.\nI would also like to express my sincerest appreciation to the UAE, our Chair for the past two years. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the UAE has done a commendable job in successfully sustaining the momentum of IORA\u2019s important work.\nIn a few months\u2019 time, it will be two years since the international community started grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. It has stretched on for longer than anticipated.\nMany IORA Member States are dependent on Blue Economy sectors, which include travel, tourism, maritime transport, and fisheries. These are severely disrupted by the pandemic.\nThe international travel and tourism sector has faced unprecedented challenges. The World Tourism Organisation called 2020 the \u201cworst year in tourism history\u201d, during which international travel fell by 74% year-on-year.\nAs we approach the end of 2021, we are starting to see some positive developments.\nMany of our countries, including Singapore, are beginning to open up for global travel in a safe and calibrated manner. We will gradually recover from disruptions to global economic activity.\nThe World Bank has estimated that global growth will accelerate to 5.6% this year. Growth among emerging markets and developing economies is expected to reach 6%.\nThis is encouraging as we continue to vaccinate our populations against the COVID-19 virus. International trade and travel with an endemic COVID-19 can only take place effectively with higher vaccination rates across countries.\nBangladesh\u2019s theme for its Chairmanship, \u201cHarnessing the opportunities of the Indian Ocean sustainably for inclusive development\u201d, is timely.\nThe Indian Ocean is a major conduit for international trade. It is an important source of fishing and mineral resources. The region is densely populated and comprises some of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies.\nThe pandemic has transformed how we think about our economies and societies. Rapid globalisation has meant that our fates are more interlinked now than ever before.\nAs we learn to live with COVID-19 and make steady progress towards a new normal, we must take care not to leave anyone behind. In this context, I would like to make the following two points.\nFirst, climate change and the need for sustainable development remain existential issues for many of us.\nThe recently concluded 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP-26, has injected fresh urgency for global climate action. More countries have committed to ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategies.\nBut much more needs to be done if we are to effectively limit global warming, which is critical to avoid the most severe effects of climate change. The Paris Agreement remains our best hope for a collective solution to this global challenge, and Parties must press on with the full implementation of the Paris Agreement Work Programme\nI am glad to see that IORA is also doing its part, spearheading sustainable development efforts, including through the IORA Blue Carbon Hub initiative, which was launched at the Third IORA Ministerial Conference on the Blue Economy in Dhaka two years ago.\nSingapore agencies have benefitted from relevant workshops organised by the IORA Blue Carbon Hub. For instance, Bangladesh\u2019s Institute for Water Modelling co-hosted the webinar on nature-based solutions for coastal risk reduction with the IORA Blue Carbon Hub in May this year. The webinar provided useful insights into some of the blue carbon projects around the world.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to tackling the effects of climate change. Climate action requires international partnerships. Singapore looks forward to working with our friends in IORA on sustainable solutions.\nThis leads me to my second point, on multilateralism.\nWe have seen how international cooperation on numerous fronts has been crucial in strengthening our capacities and delivering results for our peoples.\nFor instance, the COVAX Facility allowed more than 180 countries, including many IORA members, to benefit from a fairer and more equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Several IORA members, including Singapore, have also made contributions to the COVAX Facility. Such contribution is critical to help all of us overcome the challenges brought about by COVID-19.\nAmidst growing geopolitical uncertainty, IORA must continue to champion its relevance as a credible multilateral platform. This is premised on a rules-based international order.\nSingapore is committed to supporting multilateralism and fostering an open and inclusive regional architecture.\nPart of that commitment is evident in our efforts to encourage the sharing of experiences in capacity building through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, or SCP.\nAs a small island state, Singapore is a strong proponent of human resource development. It is key to any country\u2019s sustainable development and progress.\nIn this connection, I am pleased to note that Singapore\u2019s second virtual capacity building course for IORA Member States and the Secretariat, offered under the SCP on the topic of Project Management, was held successfully from 25 to 29 October 2021.\nOur support for the development needs of IORA Member States through the SCP started ten years ago, and we will continue to do so even amidst the pandemic. Relevant SCP courses include those under the Climate Action Package and those related to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, such as Pandemic Management, Industry 4.0, and e-Commerce. IORA members enjoy full sponsorship for these courses that are now conducted virtually.\nOn that note, allow me to conclude by thanking Bangladesh for hosting this Council of Ministers meeting. Singapore looks forward to working closely with you to usher in a new post-COVID-19 era for IORA and build a more resilient future for our communities. Thank you.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n17 NOVEMBER 2021"

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share Singapore\u2019s perspectives with fellow Ministers of APEC economies.\n2 This is the second year we are meeting virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. While there are signs of recovery in some economies, the road ahead remains bumpy. More transmissible variants could quickly lead to another surge of infections as many economies, including Singapore, have experienced.\n3 As vaccination rates go up, this should allow us to gradually reopen up our economies and borders, and transition towards endemic living.\n4 The COVID-19 pandemic has, however, demonstrated that we need to do better in order to achieve a robust, inclusive, and sustainable recovery.\n5 First, international cooperation remains key in pandemic preparedness, prevention and response, and ensuring supply chain connectivity. We need to prepare now for the next pandemic. Hence, the work that APEC has undertaken, in particular, in strengthening supply chain resilience and developing safe travel protocols, should continue.\n6 Second, digital readiness is essential. Just like how we ensure that if children cannot go to school, they can do so via online classes; we also need to support businesses by building industry and consumer confidence in the use of digital devices and technologies, so that operations can continue on digital platforms. Digital transformation, however, goes beyond new technologies and hardware. It can empower people and improve their lives. Hence, bridging the gap between the digital haves and have-nots, and boosting digital literacy, will provide more opportunities for our people to benefit from the digital economy.\n7 I am heartened to note that there are ongoing initiatives in APEC in this area but work should accelerate. We hope that the prompt implementation of the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap (AIDER) will lead to greater innovation, as well as the adoption of enabling technologies and services. At the same time, we need to foster regional and international cooperation in strengthening interoperability between different regimes and standards, so businesses can operate more easily across borders. On our part, Singapore is actively building digital partnerships with several APEC economies, like the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement with Chile and New Zealand, as well as the Digital Economy Agreement with Australia. At the WTO, Australia, Japan, and Singapore are co-convenors of the Joint Statement Initiative of E-Commerce, which seeks to establish trade rules to govern this emerging area. These serve as crucial building blocks in a larger global architecture, which will empower our economies and people to be ready for the digital revolution.\n8 Third, it is important to ensure that our economic recovery will not cause further harm to the environment. APEC, as a key multilateral fora in the region, needs to build into its agenda proposals that promote environmental sustainability.\n9 For us, we have launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a 10-year roadmap towards sustainable development and net zero emissions. Amongst others, we will plant one million more trees to transform Singapore into a City in Nature, quadruple solar energy deployment by 2025, import 30% of energy from low-carbon sources by 2035, and support the growth of sustainable enterprises through a S$180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme. We must also accept that there are costs to saving the planet.There will be opportunities in green technologies and industries, and the long-term cost of doing nothing will be much more than the cost of mitigation measures.However, protecting our environment, similar to pandemic response, requires concerted efforts at the local, regional, and global level.\n10 Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, or SCP, we have also shared our development experience with more than 132,000 government officials from over 180 developing economies since 1992. To support developing economies in their recovery efforts, we have partnered other APEC economies such as Japan, Mexico, Thailand, the US, and Viet Nam to conduct capacity building programmes on public health, digitalisation, and climate change.\n11 In brief, now more than ever, it is critical for APEC economies to work together, not only to overcome this global crisis but to also lay the groundwork for a post-COVID future that is resilient, inclusive, and sustainable for all of us and our future generations. We thank New Zealand for its leadership this year in helping to chart this path ahead and Thailand can continue to count on Singapore\u2019s cooperation for its upcoming APEC Chairmanship.Singapore supports the offer by the US and Peru to host APEC in 2023 and 2024 respectively. We look forward to working with them and other APEC economies to continue the important work of ensuring a robust, inclusive, and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "content": "QUESTION\nDr Wan Rizal To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what are the COVID-19 vaccination rates of Singaporean students studying abroad; and (b) what are the current efforts in ensuring the safety of our students overseas in a COVID-19 world.\nREPLY\nOn part (a) of the query, we do not have statistics on the COVID-19 vaccination rates of Singaporean students who are based abroad.\n2 The Singapore Government is mindful of the challenges faced by overseas Singaporeans, including our students based overseas, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been urging all Singaporeans to get vaccinated. Those who are leaving for overseas studies this year would have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in Singapore before they depart. We understand that some Singaporeans prefer to or may find it difficult to return to Singapore to be vaccinated. We have therefore launched two dedicated vaccination channels recently to make it more convenient for overseas Singaporeans, including our Singaporean students studying abroad, to return to Singapore for vaccination while minimising the time they are required to spend in SHN. As of 31 October 2021, we have received close to 250 successful sign-ups from overseas Singaporeans.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our Overseas Missions have pro-actively and regularly engaged Singaporean student communities to address their COVID-19 concerns and provided consular assistance to them if required. Our Overseas Missions have provided support and guidance to students who have contracted COVID-19 abroad or had to self-isolate due to being close contacts or from travelling. Such support includes keeping their next-of-kin in Singapore updated of their situation, and connecting the affected individuals with relevant student support groups for the provision of meals and medical supplies.\nThese regular engagements with our overseas Singaporean student community enabled our Missions to address in a timely manner any concerns raised by our students overseas and keep them abreast of the latest COVID-19 information so that they could remain safe and informed of public health and safety requirements, as well as developments in both their resident countries and Singapore. In view of the pandemic, Missions and the Singapore Global Network have increasingly leveraged social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Whatsapp, as well as local social media platforms like Weibo, to address students\u2019 COVID-19 concerns, including their queries related to travel and border measures. MFA will continue to prioritise such regular engagement and the provision of timely consular assistance and advice to Singaporean students abroad, to ensure their safety and well-being. Once again, we will urge all Singaporean students abroad to e-register with MFA if they have not already done so.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 NOVEMBER 2021"

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRSSINGAPORE3 NOVEMBER 2021Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SingaporeKeynote by Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Mr. Sam Tan on Singapore\u2019s Engagement and Interest in the Arctic at the Norway-Singapore Arctic Hybrid Conference, Wednesday, 3 November 2021Norwegian Ambassador to Singapore, His Excellency Eivind Homme,Singapore Ambassador to Norway, Mr Tan Wah Yeow,Excellencies,Distinguished guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,1 A very good afternoon to all of you. It is my privilege to join distinguished researchers and experts of sustainable energy and climate change here today at this conference. Let me first express my appreciation to the Norwegian Embassy, the Arctic University of Norway, and the NUS Energy Studies Institute for organising this event.2 Singapore and Norway are like-minded partners with warm relations, underpinned by strong maritime and economic ties. We also cooperate closely on Arctic related initiatives, including at the Arctic Council. It is thus befitting that my last Arctic-related visit in my previous capacity as Minister of State was to Troms\u00f8 for the 14th Arctic Frontiers Conference in January 2020. Today, I have the honour of delivering the keynote at this conference organised by Norway in my new capacity as Singapore\u2019s Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs. 3 2021 marks Singapore\u2019s eighth year as an observer at the Arctic Council. When we first embarked on our quest for Observership at the Arctic Council, many were puzzled about Singapore\u2019s interest in the Arctic: what commonalities do a tropical island 7,000km away from the cold and vast Arctic share?4 The truth of the matter is, that the Arctic is a globally significant barometer of changing climate patterns. The future of the Arctic\u2019s environmental wellbeing is critical for Singapore and Southeast Asia. I have said this before, and will say it again: whatever happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Vice versa however, whatever happens outside the Arctic does not stay outside the Arctic as well.Singapore sees the need for stronger international collaboration on sustainability initiatives amid the climate crisis. As Prime Minister Lee has said, this remains the \u201cexistential challenge of our times\u201d. Recent research has revealed that Arctic warming is happening three times faster than the rest of the planet. In fact, it has been predicted that sea levels could rise up to 1m towards the end of the century. As a low-lying island with one-third of our island being less than five metres above the sea level, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 6 Melting polar ice-caps pose a threat not just to the immediate surrounding region, but to low lying islands such as Singapore. As a small maritime nation situated at one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, Singapore is also interested in the possibilities and opportunities for international shipping that the opening of the Northern Sea Route presents. This new route would shorten current shipping routes between East Asia and Europe by about 40%.7 However, these developments will also bring about new opportunities. As climate change accelerates, it has spurred innovation for new ways to support growth while reducing our carbon footprint. For instance, there is an urgent need for all countries to shift towards cleaner sources of energy. Over the past decade, Singapore has switched from fuel oil to natural gas (the cleanest fossil fuel), which now makes up 95% of our fuel mix for electricity generation. By 2035, we plan to import 30% of energy from low-carbon sources. We also seek to innovate in the domain of sustainable energy, which our distinguished speakers will further elaborate on shortly. The use of Hydrogen as a low-carbon sustainable energy source has generated quite a bit of buzz in both Singapore and Norway. Singapore is actively studying and investing in advanced low-carbon solutions such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies, and hydrogen. We also plan to quadruple local solar energy production from 2020 levels by 2025. 8 There is much scope to unlock the large and mutually beneficial economic opportunities as we push for decarbonization and sustainability. International cooperation is also key as we work to improve the environmental integrity of carbon credit markets around the world, scale up green opportunities and manage potential cross-border spillover of carbon pricing and related measures taken by individual countries. Over the past few years, Singapore has invested almost S$50 million to develop low-carbon energy technology, and commissioned studies to begin examining the feasibility of using Hydrogen as a fuel. Through these studies, we have begun to identify the challenges of this alternative energy source, such as the difficulties of producing green hydrogen at scale using domestic green electricity. It is my hope that we can begin to overcome these challenges through knowledge exchanges at conferences like these.Ladies and Gentlemen,9 The impact of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem has been severely felt over the past year, with 2020 being the second-warmest year on record for the Arctic region.[1] Hence, it is necessary to strengthen global scientific cooperation and collaboration, and conferences such as these help in developing our understanding of the rapid changes impacting the Arctic.10 Singapore\u2019s Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) undertake research in Arctic technology, including facilitating remote energy access in the Arctic. Of note, the National University of Singapore\u2019s Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine contains a deep ocean water basin facility which has the potential for Arctic research applicability. We also set up the Centre for Climate Research Singapore to enhance our understanding of climate science, including how climate change in the Arctic affects polar ice sheets. I look forward to hearing the latest findings from my good friend, Professor Ben Horton from the Earth Observatory of Singapore, in his segment later.11 Since joining the Arctic Council as an Observer State in 2013, Singapore has been supporting the sustainable development of the Arctic, including through active participation in various Arctic Council Working Groups, and sharing Singapore\u2019s best practices and knowledge in areas such as preventing oil spills, conserving biodiversity, marine shipping, and sustainable energy development. In addition, we continue to offer a technical cooperation package to enhance human resource development and governance capacities for the Permanent Participants. Singapore looks forward to closely working with the Russian Chair to contribute meaningfully to the work of the Council.12 Looking ahead, Singapore seeks to further contribute to the Arctic region in a few ways. First, we look forward to promoting greater youth engagement on Arctic issues since it will be of increasing concern over the course of their lives. To raise awareness on climate action and sustainability issues amongst Singapore youths, the Singapore Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) initiated thematic years on climate action and zero waste. It also organised Singapore\u2019s Climate Action Week in August 2020 to encourage collective sustainable action. Just last year, Singapore launched the Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2030, a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda that strengthens Singapore\u2019s commitments to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspiration as soon as viable.13 Beyond youth engagement, Arctic-related research will continue to be a priority for our engagement with the region. Policy in the Arctic should be supported by science-based research, and further studies would support such an endeavour. As an Observer State to the Arctic Council, Singapore is committed to contributing to a better understanding of climate change and its impact on the Arctic. We look forward to collaborating with international experts across the research community on global efforts in adapting to climate change. We also want to find avenues for making Arctic science research inclusive and engaging for the next generation, as global climate change will impact them most.14 I look forward to an afternoon of engaging discussions, and wish you a fruitful conference. Thank you.[1] According to the EU climate monitoring service, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, surface temperatures in the Arctic in 2020 was 2.2 degree Celsius above the 1981 to 2010 average, and about 3 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels.\nSingapore\u2019s Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs, Mr Sam Tan, delivered the keynote speech at the Norway-Singapore Arctic Hybrid Conference in Singapore on 3 November 2021.\nThe conference is held in conjunction with the second Norway-Singapore Science Week, and jointly organised by the Norwegian Embassy, the Arctic University of Norway, and the NUS Energy Studies Institute. The aim of the conference is to engage key Arctic stakeholders from academia, industry and companies in a discussion on areas of cooperation between Norway and Singapore. Topics covered include sustainable energy infrastructure, the use of Hydrogen energy, as well as climate change predictions.\nIn his keynote, \u201cReflections on Singapore\u2019s engagement and interest in the Arctic\u201d, Special Envoy Tan elaborated on Singapore\u2019s interest in the Arctic region and detailed Singapore\u2019s continued engagement through our Observership at the Arctic Council (AC). He also shared about Singapore\u2019s transition towards cleaner energy sources, in response to the acceleration of climate change. Special Envoy Sam Tan\u2019s keynote speech is appended.\nAs a low-lying coastal state, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels; the Arctic is a barometer of climate change. Singapore contributes to the climate change agenda by participating in international Arctic events, raising regional awareness of Arctic issues, and contributing actively to discussions at the AC, the leading intergovernmental forum for discussing political, economic, environmental and scientific issues concerning the governments and inhabitants of the Arctic region.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 NOVEMBER 2021\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nKeynote by Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs Mr. Sam Tan on Singapore\u2019s Engagement and Interest in the Arctic at the Norway-Singapore Arctic Hybrid Conference, Wednesday, 3 November 2021\nNorwegian Ambassador to Singapore, His Excellency Eivind Homme,\nSingapore Ambassador to Norway, Mr Tan Wah Yeow,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n1 A very good afternoon to all of you. It is my privilege to join distinguished researchers and experts of sustainable energy and climate change here today at this conference. Let me first express my appreciation to the Norwegian Embassy, the Arctic University of Norway, and the NUS Energy Studies Institute for organising this event.\n2 Singapore and Norway are like-minded partners with warm relations, underpinned by strong maritime and economic ties. We also cooperate closely on Arctic related initiatives, including at the Arctic Council. It is thus befitting that my last Arctic-related visit in my previous capacity as Minister of State was to Troms\u00f8 for the 14th Arctic Frontiers Conference in January 2020. Today, I have the honour of delivering the keynote at this conference organised by Norway in my new capacity as Singapore\u2019s Special Envoy for Arctic Affairs.\n3 2021 marks Singapore\u2019s eighth year as an observer at the Arctic Council. When we first embarked on our quest for Observership at the Arctic Council, many were puzzled about Singapore\u2019s interest in the Arctic: what commonalities do a tropical island 7,000km away from the cold and vast Arctic share?\n4 The truth of the matter is, that the Arctic is a globally significant barometer of changing climate patterns. The future of the Arctic\u2019s environmental wellbeing is critical for Singapore and Southeast Asia. I have said this before, and will say it again: whatever happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Vice versa however, whatever happens outside the Arctic does not stay outside the Arctic as well.\nSingapore sees the need for stronger international collaboration on sustainability initiatives amid the climate crisis. As Prime Minister Lee has said, this remains the \u201cexistential challenge of our times\u201d. Recent research has revealed that Arctic warming is happening three times faster than the rest of the planet. In fact, it has been predicted that sea levels could rise up to 1m towards the end of the century. As a low-lying island with one-third of our island being less than five metres above the sea level, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n6 Melting polar ice-caps pose a threat not just to the immediate surrounding region, but to low lying islands such as Singapore. As a small maritime nation situated at one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, Singapore is also interested in the possibilities and opportunities for international shipping that the opening of the Northern Sea Route presents. This new route would shorten current shipping routes between East Asia and Europe by about 40%.\n7 However, these developments will also bring about new opportunities. As climate change accelerates, it has spurred innovation for new ways to support growth while reducing our carbon footprint. For instance, there is an urgent need for all countries to shift towards cleaner sources of energy. Over the past decade, Singapore has switched from fuel oil to natural gas (the cleanest fossil fuel), which now makes up 95% of our fuel mix for electricity generation. By 2035, we plan to import 30% of energy from low-carbon sources. We also seek to innovate in the domain of sustainable energy, which our distinguished speakers will further elaborate on shortly. The use of Hydrogen as a low-carbon sustainable energy source has generated quite a bit of buzz in both Singapore and Norway. Singapore is actively studying and investing in advanced low-carbon solutions such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies, and hydrogen. We also plan to quadruple local solar energy production from 2020 levels by 2025.\n8 There is much scope to unlock the large and mutually beneficial economic opportunities as we push for decarbonization and sustainability. International cooperation is also key as we work to improve the environmental integrity of carbon credit markets around the world, scale up green opportunities and manage potential cross-border spillover of carbon pricing and related measures taken by individual countries.

All three countries are Dialogue Partners of ASEAN, and have contributed to the region\u2019s peace and security over the years. Australia and the UK are also members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. We hope that the newly-established enhanced trilateral security partnership amongst Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) will contribute constructively to the peace and stability of the region, and complement the existing regional architecture which is open and inclusive.\nSingapore and ASEAN also share good and substantive relations with ASEAN\u2019s other Dialogue Partners including China. China is the largest trading partner for all ASEAN Member States, and ASEAN has also become China\u2019s largest trading partner. We welcome engagement with all stakeholders as we work together to uphold ASEAN Centrality in regional cooperation.\nSingapore has consistently articulated the importance of a peaceful, stable and secure region anchored by an open, inclusive and rules-based order in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Although competition between major powers may be inevitable, there is room for cooperation and constructive engagement between them and with other stakeholders in the region. ASEAN and our Dialogue Partners will benefit from our collective efforts to enhance regional peace, security and stability.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n5 OCTOBER 2021"

        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether he can provide an update on the situation in Afghanistan from a foreign policy perspective; and (b) how does the change in government impact the bilateral ties that Singapore has with Afghanistan especially given the past involvement of the SAF in Afghanistan.\nREPLY\nThe situation in Afghanistan remains challenging and difficult, especially the humanitarian impact on civilians. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that Afghanistan is \u201con the verge of a dramatic humanitarian disaster\u201d.\nThere have been active discussions on the situation in Afghanistan at the multilateral level, including on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. These discussions have included a focus on improving the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.\nSingapore will continue to monitor developments in Afghanistan closely. We hope that all parties, including the Taliban, will protect the safety of civilians and allow humanitarian assistance to reach the intended recipients. While the future of Afghanistan must be determined by the Afghan people, it is also in the international community\u2019s interest to see an Afghanistan at peace with itself and the world. To this end, Singapore welcomes United Nations Security Council Resolution 2593 (2021) which called for Afghanistan to, inter alia, \u201cnot be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan\u201d.\nMr Dennis Tan had referred to Singapore\u2019s past contributions as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2013. We did so because Afghanistan was a key battlefront in the global fight against terrorism. This posed a security threat to Singapore as the Jemaah Islamiyah group had direct links to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The counter-terrorism efforts of the coalition, including Singapore, have contributed to our security over the past 14 years. As terrorism remains a threat to Singapore, we certainly hope that Afghanistan will not revert to becoming a safe haven for any terrorist groups.\nOn the impact on bilateral ties, our engagement with Afghanistan has been limited to technical assistance through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). Prior to the collapse of the previous government, Afghanistan accounted for the highest number of SCP participants amongst countries in Central Asia, with 837 officials having attended our training courses. As and when the situation permits, we hope to continue this assistance through our SCP.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n4 OCTOBER 2021"

Our diplomacy is only credible if we could maintain a domestic consensus on Singapore\u2019s core interests and our foreign policy priorities. This is why MFA has undertaken sustained efforts to engage Singaporeans on our foreign policy through different means. For example, MFA works with MOE to engage our students in Junior Colleges, Millennia Institute and Integrated Programme Schools through sharing sessions by our retired ambassadors. These sessions cover our core national interests and how Singapore conducts foreign policy as a small city state in Southeast Asia. Such sessions promote two-way communication and allow our younger generation to share what foreign policy issues are top-of-mind. Through regular dialogues, we hope that our younger generation of Singaporeans can better understand the considerations when formulating and implementing our foreign policy.\nIn addition, MFA\u2019s political office holders, senior management and our foreign service officers regularly engage institutes of higher learning, think tanks, media and other fora on Singapore\u2019s foreign policy and other geopolitical developments. MFA also regularly communicates key messages on Singapore\u2019s foreign policy in a variety of formats and vernacular languages, through media interviews and digital media platforms, to reach out to Singaporeans across all age groups. What we aim for is a Singaporean public that is well-informed, that recognises the geostrategic forces at play and understand our national interests.\nMFA does not conduct regular polling of public sentiment in response to international developments.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n4 OCTOBER 2021"

As Prime Minister, you led the country through an unprecedented and challenging time amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and oversaw Japan\u2019s successful hosting of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Your leadership has also been crucial in Japan\u2019s efforts towards digitalisation and sustainable development. These efforts will benefit not only Japan but the international community as well\nI would like to thank you for your strong support for Singapore-Japan relations. Throughout the pandemic, our countries kept up high-level exchanges and cooperation, including to maintain supply chain connectivity. We also strengthened our engagement in many areas, including on third-country infrastructure development and the digital economy. On the regional front, I would like to express my appreciation to you for Japan\u2019s leadership as Chair of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) Commission, as well as Japan\u2019s commitment to promoting vaccine multilateralism\nThis year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. As we celebrate our multifaceted relations, we also look towards the many new areas of mutual interest on which we can collaborate in the future. I look forward to working with your successor to build on your good work in further strengthening our ties\nI wish you good health and the very best in your future endeavours\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Suga Yoshihide\nPrime Minister\nJapan\n4 October 2021\nDear Prime Minister Kishida,\nCongratulations on your appointment as Prime Minister of Japan. Your victory in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Presidential election is a demonstration of the trust and confidence of your party in your leadership.\nSingapore and Japan share longstanding and excellent relations. The resilience of our ties is evident from our continued cooperation and mutual support through the COVID-19 pandemic, including on connectivity and post-pandemic recovery. This augurs well for our two countries, which celebrate 55years of diplomatic relations this year. There is much more that we can do together in areas of mutual interest ranging from digitalisation to tackling common challenges like climate change and ageing societies.\nSingapore and Japan also work closely together regionally and internationally to uphold the multilateral trading system and support the rules-based order. Singapore appreciates Japan\u2019s leadership as Chair of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) Commission, and hopes to have Japan\u2019s support when Singapore takes over the Commission Chair next year. We also look forward to the early entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). As an important Dialogue Partner for ASEAN, Japan and ASEAN cooperates closely in a wide range of fields, such as the digital economy, public health and smart cities.\nWe have a very substantive agenda together, both bilaterally and multilaterally. I look forward to working with you to continue strengthening our relations and advancing our mutual interests. I fondly recall our last meeting in Singapore in September 2019, and welcome you to visit Singapore again soon.\nI wish you good health and every success.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Excellency Kishida Fumio\nPrime Minister\nJapan"

        "content": "The outcome of Singapore\u2019s third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was adopted on 1 October 2021. The adoption took place during the ongoing 48thsession of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. Singapore\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Office in Geneva, Ambassador Umej Bhatia delivered Singapore\u2019s national statement during the adoption.\nFollowing Singapore\u2019s third UPR on 12 May 2021, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Human Rights (IMC-HR) has carefully reviewed the 324 recommendations that Singapore received. Singapore has supported the majority of recommendations consistent with our ongoing efforts to ensure that Singapore continues to be an inclusive, cohesive, and resilient society, taking into account the appropriateness of these recommendations to our national context. For recommendations we have noted, Singapore already has legislation and policies that address their underlying objectives in ways that best suit our unique social and cultural context.\nAs a small, racially and religiously diverse city-State, Singapore takes a practical and outcomes-based approach towards promoting and protecting human rights. Many delegations had recognised the advances Singapore has made in promoting and protecting human rights since our second UPR in 2016. We would like to acknowledge Member States\u2019 constructive participation in Singapore\u2019s UPR and interest in our human rights journey. Singapore looks forward to continuing our engagement in the UPR process, including during the fourth cycle of UPR reviews.\nSingapore\u2019s national statement is appended.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n1 OCTOBER 2021\nTRANSCRIPT OF REMARKS BY AMBASSADOR UMEJ BHATIA, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF SINGAPORE TO THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS IN GENEVA, AT THE ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW OF SINGAPORE, 1 OCTOBER 2021\nOpening Remarks\nMdm Vice-President\nHonourable Council members\nDistinguished representatives of Observer states\nMembers of civil society,\nGood afternoon to all of you.\nLet me begin by conveying Singapore\u2019s appreciation to the Secretariat and our Troika for their invaluable support and advice throughout the course of our UPR cycle. Let me also thank our fellow States and members of civil society for sharing their perspectives and recommendations. We were deeply humbled by the number of participants that spoke during our review in May and for their constructive and encouraging words.\nThe UPR mechanism isthesignature process of the Human Rights Council. Beyond reviewing each state\u2019s human rights record, it also encourages dialogue between stakeholders on issues of great importance. Singapore welcomes the role the UPR plays in promoting the protection of human rights globally. This includes fostering an appreciation of the different approaches to the realisation of human rights.\nSingapore has engaged in each UPR cycle with great sincerity and seriousness. The UPR allows us to reflect on our human rights journey, engage constructively with our partners and peers, and share our experiences.\nSingapore\u2019s Principled Approach to Human Rights\nMdm Vice-President,\nSingapore is deeply committed to achieving better outcomes for our people in a manner that reflects our national context and realities.\nWe are a small, densely populated city-state with a multi-racial and multi-religious society.\nWe had independence thrust upon us in 1965, which led to a period of great turbulence and intercommunal strife.\nForging a common national identity while maintaining racial and social harmony has always been of paramount importance. During our 56 years of independence, we have worked continuously to pursue development, create opportunities, and maintain harmony in an enabling environment where all Singaporeans can lead fulfilling lives.\nOur unique context and history have necessitated a practical and outcomes-based approach to implement our human rights obligations.\nThis approach is based on two fundamental principles.First, human rights do not exist in a vacuum and must take into account a country\u2019s specific cultural, social, economic, and historical contexts.Second, the rule of law is a cornerstone for the promotion and protection of human rights.\nCOVID-19\nSingapore has continued to apply these principles amidst the new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a globally connected city, we were hit hard with the worst recession since our independence. This had a severe impact on every part of our society.\nWe took swift measures to protect our population, especially the most vulnerable. We implemented financial assistance schemes to support lower to middle-income households, ensured that social services and legal recourse remained available for victims of family violence, and actively tested our elderly. We also cared for our migrant workers just as Singaporeans are cared for. We made sure that they received medical care, stayed in touch with their families, and could return to work as soon as possible.\nMisinformation was a major challenge during the pandemic. To address this, we have taken an approach of complete transparency. We provided accurate, up-to-date information through multiple reliable channels, including Government websites and messaging platforms.The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act allowed us to apply corrections on falsehoods on the pandemic that affected public interest. As the original content remains up alongside the facts, people can assess both and decide for themselves which is better.\nCOVID-19 is an ongoing battle and countries will continue to have to calibrate their responses. Like many other countries, Singapore is still learning to navigate the volatile post-pandemic world. But through our human-centric approach, we hope to build the necessary social capital and resilience to progress on the road to recovery.\nRecommendations\nDuring this cycle of Review, Singapore is pleased to be able to support 210 out of the 324 recommendations received.\nFor recommendations we have noted, Singapore already has legislation and policies that address their underlying objectives in ways that best suit our unique social and cultural context. For example, the principle of equality of all persons before the law is already enshrined in the Singapore constitution. We have laws and policies to protect our people from discrimination. We are already implementing policies to strengthen social safety nets and support lower income Singaporeans, women, children, migrant workers, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. We will continue to review and improve on our approach. For instance, the Government will study the views raised during the Conversations on Singapore Women\u2019s Development, a national conversation series to gather feedback from Singaporeans on issues concerning women. Concrete proposals will be presented in a White Paper in Parliament in 2022.\nWe have also not supported recommendations predicated on unfounded assertions, inaccurate assumptions, or erroneous information. We cannot implement recommendations which are not appropriate in our national context.\nLooking ahead, I can assure you that Singapore will continue to review our policies to ensure that they are fit for purpose. The context may change, and our challenges may evolve, but our objective of achieving better outcomes for our people will remain constant.\nMdm Vice-President,\nI would like to pause now to hear from fellow States and civil society. Thank you.\nConcluding Remarks\nThank you, Mdm Vice-President,\nI would like to thank all Member States and representatives from civil society for sharing their perspectives and constructive feedback on a variety of issues.\nI would like to address some of them as follows:\nDeath Penalty\nSome civil society members raised the issue of the death penalty.\nLet me just say that international law does not prohibit the death penalty. There is no international consensus against the use of the death penalty when applied according to the due process of law and judicial safeguards. Every State has the sovereign right to determine the laws most suitable for its national circumstances within the context of its legal system and in accordance with its international obligations.\nIn Singapore, the death penalty is reserved only for the most serious crimes such as murder, drug trafficking, and the use of firearms. It has, in our experience, been an effective deterrent against such offences. But we regularly review our criminal justice system to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in keeping Singapore safe and secure.\nConscientious Objection\nOn conscientious objection, national defence is fundamental to every State\u2019s sovereignty, and given Singapore\u2019s national contexts we have no choice but to rely on conscription. This system is only viable if equally, every male Singapore Citizen and second generation Permanent Resident, regardless of race or religion, fulfils their obligations to defend our country.\nFurther, the right to freedom of religion is constitutionally protected in Singapore. However, this is not an absolute right under international law. In this context, Singapore does not recognize the universal applicability of the right to conscientious objection to military service.\nFreedom of Assembly\nOn the freedom of assembly and the treatment of human rights defenders, I would like to point out that the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under the Singapore Constitution. Consistent with international human rights law, this right is not absolute.\nThe law regulating public assemblies and processions in Singapore is the Public Order Act. Its provisions ensure adequate space for an individual\u2019s rights of peaceful assembly and expression while preserving public order. A police permit is required for cause-based public assemblies or processions so that the authorities can assess the public order risks.\nRatification of Human Rights Treaties\nRegarding the ratification of human rights treaties, Singapore takes our international obligations seriously. Our approach is to ensure the necessary legal, policy and institutional framework is in place to fully implement a treaty before we ratify it. We actively review Singapore\u2019s ability to ratify additional human rights treaties and to ensure the full and effective implementation of our treaty obligations.\nForeign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill (FICB)\nOn the FICB raised by some of the civil society colleagues.\nIt is not the Singapore Government\u2019s intent to prevent all forms of foreign influence; only those attempts at manipulation.\nOur concern lies with the use of coordinated, deceptive methods by hostile foreign actors to manipulate our political discourse and disrupt our society.\nThe Singapore Government does not intend to use the powers under the FICB againstforeign individuals, publications, NGOs and academics engaged in legitimate commentary, news reporting, civil activities or academic research that are open, transparent and with attributed comments about Singapore that are not part of a hostile information campaign.They may do so even if their views are critical of Singapore or the Singapore Government.\nThere are appeal mechanisms to ensure that there are no overreaching powers. Persons issued with Hostile Information Campaign direction(s) under FICB may apply to the Minister for Home Affairs for reconsideration, before appealing to an independent Reviewing Tribunal. To clarify, the Tribunal is chaired by a High Court judge and two other individuals from outside the Government.Appeals are made to this Tribunal and not the court, so as to protect sensitive intelligence that may be relied on to make a decision.The decisions made by the Reviewing Tribunal will be final and binding on all parties.\nLGBT Issues\nLGBT persons are members of our society; make no mistake. Just like other Singaporeans, they have access to opportunities and social support such as education, employment, and healthcare; and are protected from violence and harassment. Similarly, our social services are accessible to all members of the public, without discrimination. Violence against, and abuse, discrimination, and harassment of any person for any reason is not condoned, and the law protects LGBT individuals the same as everyone else.\nWhile Section 377A of the Penal Code remains in our laws, the Government has stated clearly that it is not enforced. We believe that in the context of Singapore, where attitudes towards homosexuality are still evolving and various communities hold different views, any move on this issue must be made carefully and sensitively, taking into consideration the sentiments of all communities.\nAll organisations offering social services are welcome to apply to be registered, and each case will be assessed on its own merits. The Government does not support the registration of organisations which advocate on sensitive issues in a socially divisive manner, including LGBT issues. This position is applied equally to all applications, regardless of whether the organisation is advocating for or against the LGBT cause.\nI hope that I have been able to provide you with a better sense of Singapore\u2019s unique circumstances. At times, this has necessitated difficult policy decisions to counter social divisions and balance competing rights.\nTo conclude, please allow me to return to first principles. Singapore is committed to build inclusivity, safeguard social cohesion, and meet the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We respect the fundamental human rights enshrined in our Constitution and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are fully committed to our human rights obligations under international law.\nI am proud to say that we have come a long way since our independence in 1965. Today, Singapore ranks 11thin the UN\u2019s 2020 Human Development Index, 1stfor Order and Security and 12thoverall in the 2020 World Justice Project\u2019s Rule of Law Index, and 12thworldwide for gender equality in the 2020 UN Gender Inequality Index.\nBut we don\u2019t intend to stop here. We remain fully cognisant that the improvement of human rights is an ongoing process and our approach must continue to evolve.\nMdm Vice-President,\nMembers of the Troika,\nFellow Member States and civil society,\nThank you very much for your time and active participation today."

Thank you for being here to witness the handover of over 120,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from the Government of Singapore to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia.\nLater tonight, the vaccines will be packed and shipped to Batam. This latest tranche of COVID-19 contributions to Indonesia bears testament to the longstanding close cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia, and especially in our ongoing fight against the pandemic. Singapore\u2019s contribution of vaccines will be channelled to the local communities in Batam and the Riau Islands, or KEPRI, province. Just a short ferry ride away, KEPRI is one of Singapore\u2019s closest neighbours and partners, and many Singaporeans are familiar with Batam. It is critical that we continue to work together so that we can emerge from the unprecedented challenges brought about by COVID-19. As we have seen from the continued spread of more contagious variants, COVID-19 is a reality that we will have to live with for some time to come. As we navigate these difficult times, I am glad that the relationship between Singapore and Indonesia has remained steadfast and strong.\nIn the face of adversity, we have demonstrated our commitment to support each other in times of need. Most recently, through our \u201cOxygen Shuttle\u201d programme, Singapore sent over 500 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indonesia. Indonesia had also facilitated the shipment of essential items for our community care facilities earlier in the pandemic. Both Singapore and Indonesia have also taken steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our people and the region by vaccinating our populations. We hope that Singapore\u2019s contribution of vaccines to Indonesia, which we had procured under the COVAX initiative, will support these efforts and the region\u2019s progress towards COVID resilience.\nIn closing, I would like to thank Gavi and AstraZeneca for facilitating these efforts. I am confident that Singapore and Indonesia will recover from this pandemic, stronger, together.

The programme will commence in 2022, and it will provide an avenue for Singapore to support the unique development priorities of FOSS Member States.\nThe transcript of Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s national statement is at Annex\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n26 SEPTEMBER 2021\nAnnex\nNATIONAL STATEMENT BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT THE 76THUNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK ON 25 SEPTEMBER 2021\nMultilateral Cooperation and Managing the Global Commons\nMr President, Excellencies, friends and colleagues.\nLet me start by congratulating His Excellency Abdulla Shahid on assuming the Presidency of the 76thsession of the General Assembly. I also thank His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, for his leadership of the 75thsession during an unprecedented and difficult year.\nThe most important lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that multilateral cooperation is absolutely essential to overcome the challenges of our global commons. Only coordinated international action can lead us to a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery.\nThis is precisely why the role of the United Nations (UN) is so crucial, especially for small and developing countries. The UN must empower countries to deal with the challenges of managing our global commons in order to build a more resilient future.\nI want to welcome and commend the leadership of UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, not only for his achievements over the past term but in putting forth a bold and visionary Common Agenda to reposition and to adapt the United Nations for the future. In particular, I welcome his proposal for a Summit of the Future to forge a global consensus.\nToday, I wish to highlight four key areas that require our urgent attention: public health, climate change, the oceans, and the digital revolution.\nFirst, the fight against COVID-19is far from over.\nAccess to vaccines remains the biggest problem faced by many countries. Our immediate priority must be to redouble efforts to expand access to vaccines by scaling up production and distribution.\nSingapore is a strong supporter of vaccine multilateralism. We will continue to support the COVAX Facility, and Singapore will donate our vaccines under the COVAX initiative to other countries with greater needs.\nWe have continued to help our friends and our neighbours where we can, through other contributions of medical supplies, oxygen, and equipment. As a trans-shipment hub, Singapore has always played our part to keep essential supplies moving to where they are needed most.\nIn the longer term, we need to take forward the recommendations of the G20 High Level Independent Panel to address the major gaps in preparedness for future pandemics. We need to strengthen the multilateral support for the WHO (World Health Organization) and the UN, and to mobilise resources for our collective security \u2013 because no one is safe until everyone is safe.\nThis brings me to my second point: we need a sustained and ambitious global response to address climate change\nThe effects of climate change are deeply felt at a local level, but the solution will depend on a collective response at a global level.\nFor a small island city-state like Singapore, climate change remains a clear and present danger. Recent extreme weather events are stark reminders that we do not have time to lose. The IPCC\u2019s (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) recent landmark report has concluded that global temperatures are likely to rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next two decades, and we are likely to see more intense rainfall, flooding, droughts, the loss of sea ice, and rising sea levels.\nThe fight against climate change will be a stark litmus test of our ability to manage the global commons through multilateral action. No country acting alone can move the needle. But if we work together, we can make a substantial impact. If we fail, the consequences will be calamitous for every country and for all humanity.\nSingapore has always been a strong advocate of the Paris Agreement from the very beginning. Last year, even while battling the pandemic, we submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy for 2050 and beyond.\nThis year, we unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which outlines a whole-of-nation approach to sustainable development, and charts ambitious, concrete targets over the next 10 years. Amongst others, we will plant one million more trees on our tiny island, we will quadruple solar energy deployments, and we will reduce the waste sent to landfills.\nWe are also committed to working with our partners in new areas such as green finance and clean energy solutions, and we look forward to substantive outcomes at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow.\nThe third global commons in urgent need of multilateral action are our oceans\nThe oceans sustain our global ecosystem; they are a repository of biodiversity and a buffer for climate change. They are also a critical artery for trade, and a source of jobs and livelihood for billions of people.\nAs a tiny island state at the confluence of key global shipping routes, heavily dependent on maritime trade, Singapore therefore is an ardent advocate of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea \u2013 UNCLOS for short.\nUNCLOS is the foundation for a rules-based governance of the oceans in all aspects. It sets the rules for maritime entitlements and provides the overarching framework for the peaceful resolution of maritime disputes. It is fundamental for maintaining open trade routes and sea lines of communication.\nThe 40thanniversary of the adoption of UNCLOS next year is an opportunity for us to reaffirm our commitment to UNCLOS as the primary legal instrument for oceans governance, and we need to do more to ensure its effective implementation.\nSingapore also firmly believes in the importance of conserving and ensuring the sustainability of our marine environment. We look forward to the fourth session of the BBNJ (Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction) Intergovernmental Conference next year, and to the second UN Ocean Conference to be co-hosted by Kenya and Portugal next year.\nThe fourth area for urgent multilateral action relates to the digital revolution and its impact on sustainable development\nThe digital revolution was well underway before COVID-19 erupted. But the pandemic has accelerated the pace and the scale of this ongoing revolution.\nDigital technologies have empowered millions of people. But the gulf of opportunities between the digital haves and the digital have-nots has actually widened. Today, 3.8 billion people remain digitally disconnected.\nAnd this digital divide has prevented access to education, to healthcare, and to many other essential services for millions of people around the world.\nDigital transformation is not just about new technologies or new hardware. Fundamentally, it must be about improving lives and empowering people, and especially the poorest and the most vulnerable. It is about strengthening the resilience of our societies and economies. In a nutshell, digital transformation should be about sustainable development.\nTo put it differently, if we do not close the digital divide, we will not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This is why digitalisation poses a global challenge and it requires a concerted global response.\nThere are many questions related to this transformation. How can we provide fair and secure access to digital data, so that the data is not monopolised by a few, and leaving the vast majority digitally disenfranchised? How can we encourage a freer flow of data across the world, to promote innovation and inclusive sustainable development? Can we find ways to address the pandemic of misinformation, which sometimes, arguably, has been worse than the pandemic itself?\nThere are no easy ready answers. But we clearly do need to have a conversation about a global framework to maximise these opportunities and to deal with the challenges posed by the digital revolution.\nThe goal is both simple and singular: how can we enhance multilateral cooperation to leverage digital technologies for sustainable development?\nThere are many paths that we can take: the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal for a Global Digital Compact, or perhaps a new UN convention on digital transformation for sustainable development, or a framework of norms and principles. I leave these options on the table to be part of a conversation that we all need to have at the global level.\nAs a tiny country, as a vital node in the international digital network, Singapore has always advocated a global architecture that is open, inclusive, inter-operable, and multi-stakeholder.\nSuch a global digital architecture must be shaped by a few guiding principles:\nOne, the voices of small states must be heard, and our concerns taken into account.\nTwo, digital transformation needs to be people-focussed, and it must improve people\u2019s daily lives.\n38. Three, we need to involve all relevant stakeholders: the government, the private sector, civil society, because it is no longer possible in today\u2019s digital world to neatly draw lines between government, industry, and citizens.\nFour, we need to \u201cthink digital\u201d, which means thinking in an integrated, multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral way. The complex problems of today and tomorrow require innovative solutions.\nAnd five, we need concrete action, through identifying a common set of \u201cdigital development goals\u201d and a framework for multilateral cooperation.\nAt the national level, Singapore is already building partnerships with many countries. We have concluded Digital Economy Agreements with several of our partners. We co-lead the WTO (World Trade Organization) Joint Statement Initiative on e-commerce with Japan and Australia, and this now includes more than 80 member economies and comprises 90% of global trade. These can be building blocks in a larger global architecture.\nAt the broader level, we need determined action to close the digital divide, not only within nations but also between nations. There is already much work being done. But we need to give these efforts a stronger push, through education, training, and, improving the digital skills and literacy of our people across the board; investing in infrastructure, for universal and affordable internet connectivity; and expanding access to data and digital public goods, including open-source software and digital utilities.\nWe can do a lot more to improve international data governance, to promote inter-operability, trust, and security when we transact in the digital environment.\nI have only touched on some of these issues that I believe we need to look at. There are other important issues outlined in the Secretary-General\u2019s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. The Common Agenda that he has set out lays out a way forward, on a global \u201cdigital technology track\u201d.\nThe next step is to take action on these proposals, and Singapore will support the efforts by the United Nations to advance our global conversation. So that together, we can make tangible progress on digital transformation for sustainable development.\nMr President, Excellencies,\nAs we seek to build a more inclusive, sustainable future, we need to give each other a hand. This is especially so for small and developing countries.\nIn 1992, Singapore established the Forum of Small States, FOSS. It is an informal platform for small states to discuss issues of mutual concern. We started off with a group of 16, and it has now grown to 108 members of the United Nations, and we will celebrate our 30th anniversary next year.\nTo mark this milestone, Singapore will launch a new \u201cFOSS for Good\u201d programme. It will commence in 2022, it will focus on priority areas such as the digital transformation and COVID-19 recovery, customised to the unique challenges faced by small countries.\nBecause we believe it is only by working in partnership, by helping each other, that we can reach a more resilient, a more inclusive, and a more sustainable tomorrow.\nIt is always darkest before dawn. But dawn will arrive. There is hope and there is much work ahead for all of us. Thank you.\nCredit for photos: Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nCaption for photos: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering Singapore\u2019s National Statement at the 76th United Nations General Assembly in New York on 25 September 2021"

        "content": "The Global Governance Group (3G) held its 14th Ministerial Meeting in New York in hybrid format on 22 September 2021 on the sidelines of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). At the 3G\u2019s invitation, the G20 Troika (previous, present and incoming Presidencies) \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Indonesia \u2013 joined the 3G Foreign Ministers to discuss the efforts being made at the G20 and United Nations to address the challenges facing the world today. This annual meeting with the G20 Troika is part of the 3G\u2019s efforts to promote a more inclusive, accountable and effective global governance framework.\nItaly, in its capacity as the 2021 G20 Presidency, updated the 3G Ministers on the outcomes of key G20 meetings to date, as well as the roadmap to this year\u2019s G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Rome on 30 and 31 October 2021. The 3G Ministers welcomed Italy\u2019s ambitious and forward-looking G20 agenda centred on three broad and interconnected pillars of action: \u201cPeople, Planet, Prosperity\u201d. They commended Italy\u2019s success in furthering the G20\u2019s swift response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts include the G20 Global Health Summit and the recommendations by the G20 High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on Financing the Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. The 3G Ministers welcomed the good progress in the various G20 tracks and working groups and the G20\u2019s focus on ensuring a green, global and sustainable post-pandemic recovery, including by bridging the global digital divide, reducing global inequalities, advancing collective action on climate issues, and supporting the United Nations\u2019 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with a focus on accelerating the implementation efforts of developing countries and countries vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn light of trade disruptions and protectionist tendencies exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 3G Ministers emphasised the continued importance of promoting an open, predictable, rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, as embodied by the World Trade Organization (WTO), to support sustainable global economic recovery. They reiterated the role of international cooperation in strengthening global supply chain resilience and ensuring unimpeded cross-border flows of food, agricultural, medical and other essential supplies. The 3G Ministers welcomed, inter alia, the G20\u2019s commitment made at the G20 Digital Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 5 August 2021 to leverage digitalisation for a resilient, strong, sustainable and inclusive economic recovery.\nThe 3G Ministers reiterated the need for robust action to address shortfalls in global pandemic preparedness and response, as well as ensure safe, affordable and equitable vaccine access for all. They applauded Italy\u2019s successful convening of the virtual G20 Global Health Summit on 21 May 2021, and welcomed the Rome Declaration\u2019s reaffirmation of the role of extensive COVID-19 immunisation as a global public good, and the importance of sustained investment in global health to achieve universal health coverage. The 3G Ministers reiterated their support for forging effective partnerships among countries to support these aforementioned aims, including through vaccine multilateralism initiatives such as the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX).\nThe 3G Ministers welcomed Italy\u2019s convening of the inaugural G20 Energy-Climate Ministerial, in particular the G20\u2019s commitment to accelerate efforts and investments to reduce short- and long-term greenhouse gas emissions, and to scale up finance and support for developing countries by, inter alia, strengthening cooperative actions on technology development and transfer and enhanced country-driven capacity building, to achieve the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.\nThe 3G Ministers welcomed the commitment of successive G20 Presidencies to engage non-G20 members, such as the 3G, to include a broad range of international interests and perspectives and strengthen multilateralism and global governance. This included the fruitful engagement with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Luigi Di Maio at the virtual 13th 3G Ministerial Meeting on 23 September 2020.\nAs Italy continues to advance its G20 Presidency agenda this year, the 3G Ministers looked forward to continuing the good partnership with the G20 under Indonesia\u2019s 2022 G20 Presidency. They encouraged Indonesia to continue the G20\u2019s strong engagement of the 3G and other regional and international organisations, in particular the United Nations. The 3G Ministers highlighted that it was important to ensure inclusiveness, coherence and complementarity at various multilateral fora, in particular when deliberating global standards.\n22 September 2021"

        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Gerald Giam Yean Song: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) which countries has Singapore donated COVID-19 vaccines to; (b) how many doses have been donated to each of these countries; (c) what is the total cost of these donations; and (d) what are the considerations for donations to higher income countries like Brunei which have the financial means to purchase their own vaccines.\nREPLY\nI would like to emphasise that we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the progress of our National Vaccination Programme, and made the decision to contribute our vaccines only when we were sure that we had, and will continue to have, enough vaccines for our people.\n2 We had contributed 100,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to Brunei on 20 August 2021. We had also contributed 20,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines to Johor on 29 June 2021, and are working towards a further donation of around 100,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to Johor. Due to contractual obligations with the vaccine manufacturers, we are not able to disclose the cost of vaccines.\n3 Mr. Giam has asked about the considerations behind contributing vaccines to our neighbours, including higher income countries. As Members of the House are aware, there are global vaccine shortages and delivery delays. I would like to express our gratitude to our vaccine procurement team for securing sufficient vaccines for our people at such an early stage. In combatting a pandemic that knows no boundaries, no one is safe until everyone is safe, and it is therefore in our collective interest to help each other. One such example is the swap arrangement with Australia. We sent 500,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to Australia recently, and we will receive the same quantity from Australia at a later date. This arrangement is mutually beneficial as it enables both countries to support each other in optimising our respective schedules for vaccinating our populations against COVID-19.\n4 Our contributions are part of our broader commitment to work together with our neighbours in confronting the pandemic. While we continue to support regional and global efforts to combat the virus, it is sensible that we begin by helping our neighbours given their proximity to us, and the large number of cross-border flows between our countries. It is hence critical that we first bring the COVID-19 situation in our region under control.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n14 SEPTEMBER 2021"

        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Leon Perera To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether and to what degree the staff working in Singapore\u2019s overseas missions have obtained access to COVID-19 vaccinations; and (b) what support is provided to Singaporeans living abroad to gain access to COVID-19 vaccinations in countries where residents\u2019 access to vaccinations is still limited.\nREPLY\nOfficers posted to our Overseas Missions are frontline and essential services personnel who have been given access to COVID-19 vaccinations. Currently, we have 359 officers based overseas and only one has not yet received the vaccination. The officer will be returning in the next few weeks and will be fully vaccinated by November 2021.\n2 On the second query, we are unable to conduct vaccination overseas for medical and legal reasons. Therefore, to the extent possible, MFA will seek the cooperation of foreign governments to extend their local vaccination programmes to Singaporeans overseas.\n3 We are also exploring options to make it more convenient for overseas Singaporeans to be vaccinated when they return to Singapore. We just announced two dedicated vaccination options under which Singaporeans overseas can receive one dose of vaccination on transit in Singapore without serving the full Stay Home Notice (SHN). The Singaporean can then return to receive his second dose on transit again after the required dosing interval. The second option is for Singaporeans overseas to receive their first dose of vaccination while serving SHN after their arrival in Singapore and the second dose post-SHN.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n13 SEPTEMBER 2021"

Individuals can complete their vaccination regimen by repeating this process for their second dose; or b.Receive the first dose upon arrival in Singaporecomplete full SHN at a dedicated facility, and receive the second dose after the required dosing interval before returning to their resident country.\nOS under Option (b) will be subject to the prevailing border measures on the pre-departure test, on-arrival testing regime as well as length of SHN based on their 21-day travel history. OS under Option (a) will also be subject to the same prevailing border measures until they depart on the next available flight/ferry. Regardless of their country/region of embarkation, the OS will be required to stay at an appointed dedicated facility where the vaccination will be offered on-site, while they are under SHN. For more information on the entry requirements to Singapore for returning Singaporeans, please visit the SafeTravel website\nWhile the COVID-19 vaccines will be provided by the Singapore Government, OS will have to bear the associated costs of returning for the vaccination, including accommodation at the designated facility, swab tests and travel expenses.\nOS should register their interest in using either vaccination channelvia https://go.gov.sg/vaccinationchannels. Prior to travelling to Singapore, OS should obtain the relevant re-entry approvals and return flight/ferry tickets to ensure they can return to their resident countries after their vaccination.

Australia was represented by Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne, Minister for Defence Peter Dutton and Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan. The SAJMC is a high-level bilateral dialogue mechanism established in 1996 by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and then-Prime Minister Paul Keating.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the excellent state of bilateral relations, underpinned by strategic convergence and economic complementarity. The Ministers noted the pivotal role that the SAJMC has played in driving the deep and multi-faceted cooperation between both countries.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the good progress in cooperation across all five pillars of the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, namely, economic, trade and investment; digital economy; foreign affairs, defence and security; science and innovation; and people-to-people links.

The Ministers reaffirmed the longstanding and strong partnership between Singapore and Australia, anchored by strategic trust and economic cooperation, and underpinned by the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). They acknowledged the unique nature of the SAJMC\u2019s 3+3 Ministerial mechanism to both countries and the key role it has played over the past two decades in strengthening bilateral cooperation.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to continue strengthening the CSP, which has made significant strides since its inception in 2015, in an increasingly uncertain and complex strategic environment. Both sides have jointly completed more than 80 initiatives across the five pillars of cooperation: economics, trade and investment; digital economy; foreign affairs, defence and security; science and innovation; and people-to-people links. The Ministers welcomed the good progress in the CSP over the past year in spite of the challenges presented by COVID-19. To keep the CSP forward-looking and ambitious, they also agreed to expand cooperation in emerging areas, including the green economy and FinTech.\nMinisters agreed that Australia and Singapore are like-minded countries with a high degree of strategic trust. They affirmed that our partnership is even more important at a time of increasing uncertainty and complexity in the regional strategic environment. They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which supports and promotes free trade and open markets and respects the rights of countries to lead their national existence free from external interference, subversion and coercion. Australia and Singapore share a vision for the region that is consistent with the principles of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, including ASEAN Centrality, openness, transparency, inclusivity, good governance, a rules-based framework, and respect for sovereignty and international law. Ministers had a fruitful exchange of views and reaffirmed their commitment to promote regional stability and respect for rules and international law\nEconomics, Trade and Investment\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the close and long-standing bilateral and regional economic relationship that both countries share, built on the upgraded Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), which was signed in December 2017, as well as the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), which is currently undergoing an upgrade. Noting the achievements under the SAFTA side letter on mutual recognition agreements, the Ministers welcomed the signing of a mutual recognition agreement between our professional accountancy bodies and look forward to progress on further mutual recognition agreements between our professional bodies as identified in the upgraded SAFTA.\nThe Ministers recognised the good cooperation amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As trusted and reliable trade partners, both countries have cooperated to ensure the resilience of our food, medical and other essential supplies. Singapore and Australia, together with a number of countries, issued a Joint Ministerial Statement affirming Commitment to Ensuring Supply Chain Connectivity amidst the COVID-19 situation issued in March 2020, and the Joint Ministerial Statement on Action Plans to Facilitate the Flow of Goods and Services as well as the Essential Movement of People issued in May 2020. Singapore Airlines has been participating in Australia\u2019s International Freight Assistance Mechanism, which has allowed the continued export of Australian agricultural produce to Singapore as well as other overseas markets.\nThe Ministers welcomed the signing of the MOUs on electronic certification cooperation and cooperation in food safety and standards in March 2020. They agreed to explore the mutual recognition of inspection regimes, which will facilitate the regional trade of food, as well as further food safety collaboration, including in novel foods and alternative proteins. The Ministers noted that the Singapore Food Agency and Australia\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment will be forming a Working Group to work out the legal provisions and export certification required for transhipments with a view to facilitate regional food trade.\nThe Ministers recognised the need for new capacities to address climate change, as well as potential for economic growth and job creation in new green sectors. In that regard, the Ministers welcomed the agreement between the Prime Ministers at the 6thLeaders\u2019 Meeting in June 2021 to explore a bilateral Green Economy Agreement (GEA), which would facilitate trade and investment in environmental goods and services, strengthen environmental governance, and contribute efforts to build global capacity to address climate change. The Ministers agreed to establishing a Joint GEA Working Group to facilitate scoping discussions in September 2021, with a view to launching formal GEA negotiations by 1 October 2021.\nDigital Economy\nThe Ministers welcomed the establishment of a dedicated Digital Economy pillar under the CSP in March 2020. They recognised the significance and ambition of the Singapore-Australia Digital Economy Agreement (SADEA), which entered into force in December 2020, to support growth of the digital economy and enable firms to operate seamlessly using common and interoperable standards. They welcomed ongoing cooperation under the SADEA in areas such as artificial intelligence, data innovation, trade facilitation, exchange of e-certifications for agricultural products and e-invoicing. The Ministers noted the successful conclusion of a trial, conducted together with businesses, using blockchain to prove trade documents can be issued and verified digitally across two independent systems. Building on the SADEA, the Ministers noted that both sides have commenced discussions on a FinTech Bridge to enhance bilateral FinTech cooperation. Australia and Singapore look forward to holding a Dialogue on Digital Economy, under the auspices of the SADEA.

Most notable were the entry into force of the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area Development in 2020. The Ministers expressed their satisfaction that, despite the pandemic, the Singapore Armed Forces\u2019 training such as theExercise Wallaby 2021, and Republic of Singapore Air Force detachments, as well as the joint development of training areas and advanced training facilities in Queensland, are progressing as scheduled; and Singapore continues to provide support for Australian aircraft and ships in the region. They welcomed the commitment, close cooperation and support of both countries in the ASEAN Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) and reaffirmed their commitment to the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), which will mark its 50thanniversary this year.\nThe Ministers acknowledged the deepening security cooperation, including on counter-terrorism (CT), cybersecurity and critical technology issues. Both countries maintain close contact on CT issues through the annual bilateral CT dialogue, which remains a valuable platform to exchange views on managing the evolving terrorism threat. Australia remains committed to support Singapore\u2019s efforts for CT through the deployment of an Australian liaison officer to the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility in Singapore. Both countries also maintain close bilateral and regional cooperation on cybersecurity issues, and have forged close cooperation in international cyber discussions at the United Nations. The Ministers welcomed the renewal of the MOUs on cooperation in cybersecurity and CT in March and June 2020 respectively, and looked forward to the conclusion of the MOU on homeland security operational science and technology cooperation. The Ministers acknowledged the growing importance of leveraging emerging and critical technologies to advance national security and promote economic progress whilst enabling social cohesion. They recognised that cyberspace and critical technologies are pivotal to our shared goal of a safe, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region and world.\nScience and Innovation\nThe Ministers welcomed the signing of the MOU on Low-Emissions Solutions in October 2020, which is a positive first step in cooperating in the area of emerging low-emissions technologies. Driven by their mutual support for an effective global response to climate change, the Ministers noted that the MOU will accelerate the development and uptake of new and emerging low emissions technologies with collaboration on hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, renewable energy trade, and emissions measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). They reaffirmed support and noted progress made on the partnership, particularly the announcement by Prime Ministers at the 6thLeaders\u2019 Meeting in June 2021, to establish a $30 million partnership to accelerate the deployment of low emissions fuels and technologies, like zero or low-emissions hydrogen, to reduce emissions in maritime and port operations.\nThe Ministers welcomed the launch of the pilot phase of the A*STAR-CSIRO Research-Industry (2+2) Partnership in October 2020 to promote bilateral collaborations in Science, Technology and Innovation. They took note of the successful conclusion of the 1stSingapore-Australia Bilateral Programme on \u201cInnovations in Food for Precision Health\u201d in June 2021, which was launched by A*STAR and CSIRO to strengthen R&D cooperation on the health and safety impact of food innovation as well as consumer\u2019s attitudes and behaviours towards novel foods and technologies. The Ministers also welcomed the new MOU signed by the health ministries in June 2021 to enhance cooperation in healthcare and health technologies, which will facilitate deeper exchanges of information, knowledge and expertise to support timely and affordable access to medicines and health technologies for Singaporeans and Australians.\nPeople-to-People Links\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the warm and close personal links between the peoples of Singapore and Australia. They agreed on the importance of safely reopening borders based on medical advice to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and maintaining people-to-people links between the two countries. They welcomed the ongoing discussions between officials to work out the detailed operational requirements for the resumption of regular two-way air travel by the end of this year. This work will include the interoperability of our respective high-quality health and vaccination certificate systems. As announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison during his recent visit to Singapore, Australia would prioritise the return of Singapore students enrolled in Australian universities. In this regard, the Ministers discussed ways to facilitate the return of Singapore students to Australia to resume their studies as soon as possible.\nThe Ministers noted the strong arts and cultural cooperation between both countries. The Australia-Singapore Arts Group held its 6thmeeting virtually in November 2020, and convened a very successful 3rdCultural Leaders\u2019 Forum attended by key cultural leaders from both countries and ASEAN member states. The Ministers also welcomed the renewal of the MOU between the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in June 2021, which is a testament that cultural exchanges continue to flourish amid COVID-19 through innovative and digital ways of working and performing together.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the close and substantive exchanges between our public services, anchored by the renewal of the MOU on cooperation between the Singapore Public Service Division and the Australian Public Service Commission in August 2020. They noted the productive discussions at the 7thPublic Service Roundtable in July 2021, during which both sides exchanged views on tackling the common challenges faced by our respective public services, particularly on the strategies to deal with an endemic COVID-19, and the continued transformation of the public service to meet the needs of tomorrow.\nRegional Cooperation and Global Developments\nThe Ministers exchanged views on regional cooperation and global developments. They discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, agreed to continue working closely to keep supply chains functioning, and reiterated the importance of equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. They encouraged the sharing of good practices and strengthening of cooperation in countering the spread of COVID-19 disinformation and misinformation which can cause serious harm.\nThey agreed to strengthen ASEAN-Australia relations, and reaffirmed their commitment to ASEAN Centrality and the ASEAN-led regional architecture, including the East Asia Summit as the region\u2019s premier Leaders-led forum for strategic discussion and cooperation. Ministers welcomed Australia-Singapore cooperation on marine plastics debris in the East Asia Summit. They recognised the contribution of ASEAN-Australia cooperation to regional stability, resilience and prosperity, and discussed Australia\u2019s support to the region\u2019s recovery from COVID-19 through the AUD523.2 million Vaccine Access and Health Security Initiative and AUD21 million of support for the ASEAN Centre for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed the importance of supporting free trade and open markets, as the world transitions from \u201cpandemic to endemic\u201d. Increasing global trade and investment linkages will continue to support countries in their individual journeys of economic restoration and recovery. In that regard, the Ministers agreed to work closely to support free trade at multilateral platforms and initiatives such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the G20. The Ministers also agreed to continue to work with partners in the region to protect and strengthen the open, rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core. Both sides looked forward to the early entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which would further secure the region\u2019s recovery from the economic impact of COVID-19.\nThe Ministers expressed concern about the death toll and continued violence in Myanmar, especially against unarmed civilians, as well as the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation amidst the third wave of COVID-19 in the country. They called for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all political detainees including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and inclusive dialogue between all parties to seek a durable and peaceful solution in the interests of the people of Myanmar. They also called for the immediate release of foreign political detainees, including Australian Professor Sean Turnell. They agreed that the priority is for the Tatmadaw to follow through with its commitment at the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting in April 2021 to fully and effectively implement the Five-Point Consensus as soon as possible, including the provision of humanitarian assistance to be coordinated by the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre). The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate through the AHA Centre to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar. They also reaffirmed their support for Minister of Foreign Affairs II of Brunei Darussalam as the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on Myanmar in his work on the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus and looked forward to his visit to Myanmar, to meet with all parties concerned.\nThe Ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintain and promote peace, security and stability in the region, as well as the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which is universal in character and sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. They underlined Singapore and Australia\u2019s strong support for the right of freedom of navigation and overflight, and unimpeded trade in the South China Sea. They also reaffirmed the importance of compliance with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). They emphasised the importance of non-militarisation of disputed features and self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability. They urged all claimants to take meaningful steps to ease tensions and build trust, including through dialogue. The Ministers acknowledged work towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and emphasised the importance of the Code being effective and consistent with international law, including UNCLOS, and not prejudicial to the legitimate rights and interests of other States under the UNCLOS.\nThe Ministers expressed deep concern over the rapidly evolving and dangerous situation in Afghanistan. They called on the Taliban and all other parties to respect and facilitate the safe and orderly departure of those who wish to leave the country.

Singapore continues to be confident of India\u2019s growth prospects and remains the largest source of foreign direct investment annually. As we look ahead and seek to future-proof our workforce and economies, our two countries are also pursuing greater cooperation in emerging areas of Fintech, digitisation, and innovation.\nSingapore has just assumed the role of Country Coordinator for ASEAN-India Dialogue Relations this month. We look forward to working with India to deepen India\u2019s engagement of the region and to strengthen the ASEAN-India Strategic Partnership.\nGiven the wide-ranging cooperation between our two countries, I am confident that relations between Singapore and India will continue to strengthen as we emerge from the pandemic.\nPlease accept my best wishes for Your Excellency\u2019s good health and continued success.\nHALIMAH YACOB"

        "date": "03 Aug 2021, 20:25",
        "country": "Israel",
        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Zhulkarnain Abdul RahimTo ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs what can the Government do to (i) help de-escalate the tension in Israel and the Palestinian Territories to avoid the loss of innocent lives and protect from damage the UNESCO World Heritage religious sites in the Old City of Jerusalem which include the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Wailing Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and (ii) monitor and ensure the safety of all Singapore citizens who are currently residing in Israel.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian Balakrishnan: We need to understand the context of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict that led to the tragic loss of many innocent lives in May 2021.\nFirst, the 11-day outbreak of violence in May 2021 was the fifth major military confrontation between Israel and Hamas in the last 15 years. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but retained control over the border crossing and the supply of goods into Gaza from the Israeli side. The Palestinians have accused Israel of imposing a blockade of Gaza. On Israel\u2019s part, it has experienced recurrent indiscriminate rocket attacks from Gaza and armed border incursions over the years. In this latest round, an unprecedented number of more than 4,000 rockets were fired indiscriminately at civilian areas in Israel. Israel has also accused Hamas of launching rockets from civilian areas in Gaza. Although a majority of rockets were intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome missile defence system, a dozen people were killed, including one child. On the Gaza side, the Palestinian toll was higher, with Palestinian health authorities reporting about 250 deaths, including 60 children. Gaza\u2019s civilian infrastructure was also badly damaged and over 77,000 civilians were displaced according to UN figures. Tragically, the cycle of violence has not been broken over the last 15 years and civilians on both sides have been the victims. We are all deeply saddened by the loss of innocent civilian lives.\nSecond, this latest episode was related to earlier violent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in Jerusalem, including on the Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount and the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. Clashes in the vicinity of the Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount are always very sensitive given its sanctity and religious significance for Christianity, Islam and Judaism. That these took place during the holy month of Ramadan only exacerbated tensions. When Hamas decided to launch rocket attacks on Israel on 10 May, it had publicly claimed that it was doing so in the name of \u201cdefending Jerusalem and Islam\u201d. Given Jerusalem\u2019s importance to all the Abrahamic religions, incidents at key religious sites will inflame emotions and be easily exploited by various groups to advance political causes. However, this does not mean that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a religious one. At its core, the conflict has always been about territory, self-determination and identity which has been ensnared by Israeli and intra-Palestinian politics.\nThird, the situation in Gaza is partly a reflection of intra-Palestinian political rivalries. The West Bank is governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and controlled by the Fatah party. However, the PA no longer governs Gaza after Hamas seized unilateral control in 2007. The political divide between the West Bank and Gaza has remained despite past attempts at forging a national unity government between Fatah and Hamas. Unlike Fatah, Hamas does not recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist and believes in armed conflict. In an interview in May 2020, Palestinian academic Dr Khalil Shikaki said that Palestinians in Gaza viewed the use of violence as an effective solution against Israel, and that support for armed resistance was notably higher among Palestinian youth compared to the older generation. It therefore comes as no surprise that public Palestinian polls have indicated that popular support for Hamas has considerably increased following its latest attacks on Israel, as was the case immediately after the 2014 Gaza War.\nFourth, given the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, achieving a resolution has been extremely difficult. The historic Oslo Accords in 1993 gave rise initially to optimism that a two-state solution and Israel\u2019s right to exist in peace could be realised at some point. Regrettably, there has been limited progress despite attempts by the international community, including the Quartet, to support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The lack of visible progress has made it even more difficult to realise a peaceful outcome. Public polls show that support for a two-state solution within Israel appears to be waning. Similar polls show that many Palestinians believe a two-state solution to be neither achievable nor viable.\nI have first provided some context so that Singaporeans can have a better appreciation of the ground realities in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza beyond the media headlines and polemics. This is also the context for the Singapore Government\u2019s longstanding, consistent and principled position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nFirst, Singapore\u2019s primary concern has always been the safety and security of civilians on all sides. International law and agreements must be upheld. On 9 May, MFA expressed deep concerns and urged all sides to stop the violence following the clashes on the Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount. On 12 May, MFA called upon all parties to cease attacks against civilian targets and work towards a durable ceasefire. Gaza is a densely populated area and the risk of civilian casualties is high. On its part, Hamas should not use civilians as shields by launching indiscriminate rocket attacks at Israel from civilian sites. On 21 May, we welcomed the mutual ceasefire and urged both sides to avoid further loss of civilian lives. We also called for the swift and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to affected civilians. As with past conflicts in Gaza in 2009 and 2014, Singapore will continue to support humanitarian assistance efforts for the Palestinians. For example, the Singapore Government donated US$100,000 as seed money to the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) for its fund-raising appeal. I am heartened that Singaporeans have responded generously by contributing almost S$4.5 million to the fund-raising drives by the SRC and the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Fund (RLAF), which will be channelled through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Palestinian Red Crescent in support of their humanitarian and relief efforts. This is a testament to the Singaporean spirit of compassion for others in need.\nSecond, the cycle of violence in Gaza must stop. While the damaged infrastructure in Gaza can be rebuilt, the cynical view is that it is inevitable that another round of violence would erupt again. This will continue unless all sides are willing to make the necessary compromises and refrain from further violence. In this regard, Singapore welcomes efforts by key regional countries such as Egypt in strengthening the ceasefire in Gaza and facilitating negotiations between the relevant parties.\nThird, Singapore will continue to support the Palestinian Authority\u2019s (PA) capacity-building efforts. The Singapore Government has committed S$10 million under the Enhanced Technical Assistance Program (ETAP). Since its inception in 2013, the ETAP has hosted customised study visits and training programmes for over five hundred Palestinian officials in line with the PA\u2019s priorities such as public administration, economic development and urban development. We have also sponsored Palestinian students to pursue post-graduate degrees in our local universities.\nFourth, Singapore has taken a consistent and principled position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We support a negotiated two-state solution that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. This is the only viable option to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution. While the international community can help support this process, the Israeli and Palestinian leadership ultimately need to have the political will to resolve this conflict. Concessions have to be made by both sides. We hope that the leaders on both sides will find a way to engage in serious negotiations on the two-state solution in the interest of their peoples and regional stability. In the meantime, we call on all sides to refrain from taking any actions that would further escalate tensions.\nMFA continues to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans residing in the region. MFA had reached out early to check on their welfare. MFA reminded them to be vigilant and to take the necessary precautions for their personal safety. MFA will continue to work with our Honorary Consulate-General in Tel Aviv to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans in Israel as necessary. We also urge those who have not e-registered with us to do so immediately so that we can reach out to them in the event of an emergency.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n3 AUGUST 2021"

The Singapore Embassy in Yangon has been providing regular consular advice and updates on the situation in Myanmar to them. Presently, there are three relief flights a week from Yangon to Singapore which are operated by Singapore Airlines and Myanmar National Airlines. Singaporeans can book the flights directly with the airlines to return home.\nMFA cannot guarantee that these relief flights will continue on a regular basis throughout August and beyond. In such scenario, we may also not be granted permission to conduct repatriation flights. Consequently, MFA has advised Singaporeans currently in Myanmar to consider leaving as soon as they can via commercially operated flights. The situation in Myanmar remains volatile, compounded by the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases which has placed tremendous stress on the public health system in Myanmar. Singaporeans who choose to remain in Myanmar must consider the risks to their health and personal safety. If they have not yet e-registered with MFA, they are strongly advised to do so immediately.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n2 AUGUST 2021"

Following the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, we have launched an \u201cOxygen Shuttle\u201d programme to send more than 500 tonnes of liquid oxygen in regular shipments to Indonesia from July to August 2021. We have also provided oxygen cylinders, ventilators, and oxygen concentrators, as well as medical supplies and equipment, such as surgical and N95 masks, gloves, and gowns. These were dispatched in two batches from Paya Lebar Air Base on 9 July and Changi Naval Base on 11 July respectively. We had previously sent Universal Transport Media (UTM) swabs, hand sanitisers, and face masks to Malaysia, as well as COVID-19 diagnostic tests and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine to Brunei.\nWe also contributed 3,000 diagnostic tests and one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine to the Philippines in March 2020. A total of 27,000 diagnostic tests, two PCR machines, one million surgical masks, and 200,000 bottles of hand sanitiser were also sent to Myanmar in March and October 2020.\nFurthermore, PM has also announced that Singapore intends to donate our vaccine allocation through the COVAX Facility to other countries. The COVAX Facility is a global vaccine distribution scheme that aims to guarantee fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries.\nMany Singapore-based private sector entities and philanthropic organisations have also played crucial roles. Temasek Foundation made generous donations of diagnostic tests, PCR machines, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and BiPAP machines to Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, while the Singapore Red Cross has also donated surgical masks and coveralls to our ASEAN neighbours. Likewise, some of our neighbours, such as Thailand and Vietnam have donated medical supplies to us in our times of need.\nWe remain committed to working together with our neighbours. We are exploring the provision of further assistance to our neighbours, and will continue to support regional and global efforts to combat the virus.\nTurning to ASEAN, Singapore has actively contributed to ASEAN\u2019s efforts to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we pushed for ASEAN to coordinate its response and this resulted in the establishment of the ASEAN Coordinating Council Working Group on Public Health Emergencies. In 2020, the Working Group agreed to, among others, establish the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund.\nPM Lee announced Singapore\u2019s contribution of USD 100,000 to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund at the 37thASEAN Summit in November last year. This added to the initial contribution from all ASEAN Member States, and numerous other pledges we have received from individual ASEAN Member States as well as ASEAN\u2019s external partners. Since then, ASEAN has agreed to use the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund to purchase vaccines for ASEAN Member States and the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta. This effort, which is underway, is led by Brunei as the ASEAN Chair and the ASEAN Secretariat.\nMitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic goes beyond medical supplies. We need a multi-prong strategy for the region\u2019s recovery from COVID-19. Consequently, we supported the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework and its Implementation Plan launched by the ASEAN Leaders last November. Beyond enhancing health systems, the Implementation Plan also addresses steps that the region must take to strengthen human security, improve economic integration, accelerate digital transformation, while working towards a more sustainable and resilient future.\nSingapore has actively engaged in discussions with ASEAN Member States on various initiatives to improve the region\u2019s response to future public health emergencies. ASEAN announced the launch of an ASEAN Centre for Public Health Emergencies in November last year. Singapore supports the Centre\u2019s establishment as this will help boost the long-term capacity of ASEAN Member States to detect and respond to emerging diseases.\nWe also finalised the ASEAN Strategic Framework for Public Health Emergencies and agreed to start an ASEAN Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies. The Framework is envisioned to provide ASEAN\u2019s standard operating procedures in response to public health emergencies, strengthen the capacity of ASEAN\u2019s public health networks and complement existing ASEAN agreements on health matters and relevant international agreements.\nTackling the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in ASEAN is not something Singapore or any ASEAN Member State can do alone. We will continue to support ASEAN\u2019s efforts, as well as work with our external partners to forge our response to the scourge of COVID-19. No one is truly safe until everyone is safe.\nQUESTION\nMr Alex Yam Ziming:To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can provide an update on the Ministry\u2019s assessment of any meaningful progress on the implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point consensus for an end to violence and start of dialogue in Myanmar.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian Balakrishnan: The Five-Point Consensus was agreed to by all the ASEAN Leaders and the Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military. The Five-Point Consensus called for (i) the immediate cessation of violence and all parties to exercise utmost restraint, (ii) commencement of constructive dialogue among all parties to seek a peaceful solution, (iii) the appointment of a special envoy or envoys of the ASEAN Chair to facilitate mediation and (iv) for the envoy(s) to be given access to all parties concerned; and (v) the provision of humanitarian assistance through the AHA Centre. ASEAN Leaders also called for the release of all political detainees. Brunei, in its capacity as ASEAN Chair for 2021, visited Myanmar from 3 to 5 June 2021 with the ASEAN Secretary General to hold preliminary discussions with the Myanmar military authorities.\nASEAN Member States are working on the implementation of the Consensus, including the nomination of an ASEAN envoy comprising a team of eminent individuals, the modalities of sending such an envoy, as well as how and when to disburse humanitarian assistance.\nThe implementation of the Five-Point Consensus has been very slow so far, and we are working within ASEAN to expedite this process. It is imperative that the Myanmar military authorities uphold their commitment to implement the Five-Point Consensus, which is totally unrelated to their Five-Point Roadmap. The stakeholders in Myanmar must decide to come together to seek genuine dialogue, negotiation, and reconciliation. There are no quick fixes for the situation in Myanmar. The process is a difficult one, and will take time. Singapore, along with ASEAN, stands ready to help.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n26 JULY 2021"

And of course, in the last few months, with the spread of the Delta variant across the world, this challenge has intensified. The situation in Indonesia right now is also due to the spread of the Delta variant, and as close neighbours and partners, we stand in solidarity with all the people of Indonesia.\nToday, you see the two planes which represent our first tranche \u2013 they carry ventilators, oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders. There are also equipment including PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and other supplies needed for the medical response. If you think back over the past one and a half years in the initial phase, I remember early last year, we had also supported Indonesia by sending test kits and other equipment. In return \u2013 I think many people may not be aware \u2013 when we had to establish community care facilities very quickly, the Republic of Indonesia was very helpful to us in supplying essential equipment and furniture which we needed to outfit this. So now, at their point in need, we stand in solidarity with them in support. It is this kind of mutual support that represents the strength of our relationship \u2013 not just at the government-to-government level, but at the people-to people-level. So Ambassador, this is a physical manifestation of the strength of our relationship and our solidarity with the people of Indonesia.\nThe SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) and TNI (Indonesian National Defence Forces) are also working very closely together. This operation would not be possible if not for the direct participation of the SAF and TNI. So we thank our men in green and blue around here. In fact, the additional tranche of assistance will also be delivered through the Republic of Singapore Navy. This is a whole-of-Government, whole-of-Singapore effort to stand with our brothers and sisters and the men in uniform in the Republic of Indonesia. Thank you.\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks to media at the ceremony for the handover of Singapore\u2019s assistance to Indonesia at Paya Lebar Air Base.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Indonesian Ambassador Suryo Pratomo with the Republic of Singapore Air Force Mission Crew.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Indonesian Ambassador Suryo Pratomo inspecting the medical supplies and equipment, including oxygen cylinders, for Indonesia.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Singapore\u2019s assistance package being loaded into the Republic of Singapore Air Force C-130 aircraft.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Defence, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Singapore\u2019s assistance package being loaded into the Republic of Singapore Air Force C-130 aircraft.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Defence, Singapore"

We categorically reject the use of lethal force against unarmed civilians. It is deplorable, and unacceptable under any circumstances. We have called on the Myanmar military authorities to put an end to further violence and bloodshed, and for all sides to refrain from escalating tensions. We have also called for the release of all political detainees so that all stakeholders can negotiate in good faith to find a durable and peaceful political situation. We have conveyed our views both in this Chamber and directly to the Myanmar military authorities.\n3 Singapore voted in favour of the UN General Assembly resolution as the key elements of the resolution are consistent with Singapore\u2019s position calling for an end to the violence and for all stakeholders to begin a process of genuine political dialogue and national reconciliation in Myanmar. The resolution also recognises the central role of ASEAN and calls on all stakeholders in Myanmar to cooperate with ASEAN and the Special Envoy or Envoys of ASEAN to swiftly and fully implement the Five-Point Consensus reached at the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting on 24 April. We also support the resolution\u2019s calls for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to safely reach those in need.\n4 Singapore complies strictly with international obligations on international arms sales and transfers, and abides by UN sanctions or embargo against any country. On declaration of arms exports, Singapore submits reports to the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) on international arms transfers every year. That information is listed on the UNROCA website. As shown, Myanmar is not one of the countries.\n5 Singapore has a robust export control regime, and our control lists are updated regularly to ensure that our export control system is aligned with international non-proliferation regimes. We will not hesitate to take action against those who contravene our laws.\n6 Mr Dennis Tan has also asked whether the fact that ASEAN Member States voted differently on the UN resolution has any bearing on ASEAN\u2019s efforts in fulfilling the Five-Point Consensus. We would like to point out that no ASEAN Member State voted against the UN resolution. The Five-Point Consensus was agreed to by all the ASEAN Leaders and the leader of the Myanmar military. This common vision of the way forward has not changed. That said, we recognise that implementation of the Five-Point Consensus has been slow and a little disappointing. We are working within ASEAN to expedite this process, with a view to alleviate the humanitarian situation, cease the violence in Myanmar, and set it back on the path of direct negotiation by all stakeholders that will lead to normalcy, peace, and stability for the long term. This will not be an easy or quick process, and its success ultimately lies in the hands of the Myanmar people. Nonetheless, ASEAN will not waver in its commitment to facilitate and support this process in line with the Five-Point Consensus.\n7 Singapore is fully committed to supporting ASEAN\u2019s efforts in facilitating a return to normalcy, peace, and stability in Myanmar, including through the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. We must recognise that ultimately, the key stakeholders in Myanmar must find the political will to negotiate, compromise, and find a durable political solution that is in the interest of the people of Myanmar. We hope that wisdom and good sense will prevail, and we are ready to do our part.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n6 JULY 2021"

This black swan underlines the importance of international cooperation. Because no country is an island.\nI want to focus on the fundamentals needed to reinvigorate Regional Cooperation\nTheoretically, it should be easier to cooperate regionally than globally. After all, we live in the same neighbourhood and there are fewer countries to deal with. As the Chinese saying goes, \u8fdc\u4eb2\u4e0d\u5982\u8fd1\u90bbA neighbour is better than a relative who lives far away.\nHowever, this is not always true. So I would like to add a qualifier, \u201chelpful\u201d. I insert this qualifier because we all know that if neighbours are at loggerheads, faraway friends are better!\nAsia is a diverse continent of many different ethnicities, languages, religions, cultures and civilisations. And it is still burdened by lingering historical legacies and disputes. So it is to be expected that some countries look to faraway friends to secure themselves\nBut this does not remove the need for building good neighbourly ties. Hence, the importance of reinvigorating regional cooperation\nHow? By building understanding, confidence and trust.\n9 The most important element in this process is to have a shared goal for all countries in Asia to work towards.\n10 My proposed vision is a Peaceful and Prosperous Asia. It is a simple and clear goal. No one should disagree. Although achieving it is far from straightforward, it can be done.\nPeace in Asia\n11 Let me illustrate with the example of ASEAN. ASEAN was formed about 55 years ago. Five countries \u2013 Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore \u2013 came together to promote political, economic and social stability in Southeast Asia amid rising tensions in Asia. They were not politically close. You might say they were distant neighbours. Their leaders, Suharto, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ferdinand Marcos, Thanom Kittikachorn and Lee Kuan Yew had the wisdom to advance their national interests through collective interests. These national leaders had the vision of international statesmen. The same vision motivated ASEAN to expand to 10 member states. All member states are very different from one another in terms of geography, history, political systems, languages, religions and stages of economic development. But they share the same vision of a peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia.\n12 Recent developments in Myanmar are a litmus test for the ASEAN Way. ASEAN needs to act quickly to implement the Five-Point Consensus reached during the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting. This will be a crucial step to facilitate Myanmar\u2019s return to peace, stability and normalcy.\n13 ASEAN Member States have enshrined their principles of cooperation in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Beyond ASEAN, more than 30 other partners have also acceded to the Treaty. These include the US, China, Japan, South Korea, and India. The treaty commits countries to: respect each other\u2019s independence and sovereignty; not interfere in one another\u2019s internal affairs; and settle differences and disputes by peaceful means and in accordance with the international rule of law.\n14 To reinvigorate regional cooperation in Asia, I offer three more principles. First, maximise areas of cooperation, and minimise areas of dispute. Where possible, we should try to resolve issues amicably and rationally. Where possible, compromise. Even when resolution is not possible, disagreements and disputes in some areas need not stand in the way of cooperation and collaboration in other areas that are mutually beneficial. Second, prosper thy neighbours, not beggar them. Let\u2019s play a positive-sum game, not a zero-sum game. It is better to cooperate to grow and share the pie equitably than fight over our share of a fixed pie. Third, reflect and learn from history, and not be shackled by it. This is easier said than done as histories shape citizens\u2019 collective memories and sense of national pride. But if we cannot let go of historical wounds and wrongs, and if we can never forgive, we will not be able to move forward.\n15 These principles will provide the overarching framework for a peaceful Asia that all stakeholders respect and abide by.\n16 Who are these stakeholders? China is the principal protagonist. Napoleon once said, \u201cLet China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.\u201d In the 1980s and 1990s, after Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s approach of reform and opening up, the key question within the international community was, \u201cWhen will China rise?\u201d After China\u2019s accession to the WTO and explosive growth, the question evolved to, \u201cHow will China rise?\u201d Then-President Hu Jintao assured the world of a \u201cpeaceful rise\u201d. Lee Kuan Yew pointed out to Zheng Bijian, former Central Party School Executive Vice President , that \u201cany rise is something that is startling\u201d. Indeed, Lee Kuan Yew was right. China\u2019s rise has startled and disconcerted the US. We should heed Graham Allison\u2019s warning of the Thucydides Trap. Today, the question is, \u201cNow that China has risen, what does it mean for my country and for the world? Will China play a positive-sum game?\u201d\n17 China holds the key to Asia\u2019s future and to reinvigorating regional cooperation. In 2003, at the first ASEAN-China Summit, I observed to then-Premier Wen Jiabao that China was like an elephant entering a swimming pool where there were other smaller animals. No matter how gentle the elephant was, it still needed to be careful of its every move, because it might, even unintentionally, step on the toes of the other animals. Two decades on, the elephant is much bigger and still growing, but the size of the pool is still the same.\n18 The principles I shared earlier on regional cooperation apply to all countries. But in the world of realpolitik, the behaviour of the larger and more powerful countries determines the peace and prosperity of Asia.\n19 I have been to China many times since my first visit in 1971. I have had the good fortune of meeting all the top Chinese leaders, from Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping. I have positive impressions and good vibes of China. I believe that China is focused on uplifting its people through economic growth, rather than seeking hegemony in Asia or challenging the US for global dominance. I am convinced that China\u2019s growth is positive for Asia and the world.\n20 But there are people who fear that China may become a less than gentle elephant. Accurately or inaccurately, critics have drawn attention to China\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior diplomacy\u201d. This term shapes people\u2019s perceptions of an increasingly muscular and aggressive China. While I understand why China needs to stand up firmly for its interests, how China conducts its diplomacy does shape how others view China.\n21 In May, President Xi Jinping urged Politburo members to portray an image of a \u201ccredible, lovable, and respectable\u201d China. President Xi\u2019s words are welcomed. The world will no doubt be watching China\u2019s actions closely to see what will change and what will not change.\n22 We cannot have real regional cooperation if China does not have the confidence and trust of its neighbours. Achieving this requires more than a change in the tone, style and language of public communications.\nProsperity in Asia\n23 Let me now turn to prosperity, and the three features of a prosperous Asia.\n24 First, a prosperous Asia is interconnected through the free flow of goods, services and investments, within Asia and beyond. In the near term, our top priority should be to keep supply chains intact. Trade, especially in essential supplies, can then continue to flow unimpeded. Cooperation on the digital economy is also key. Countries should jointly develop the interoperable frameworks needed for an open and integrated global digital economy.\n25 Most importantly, we should press on with economic integration in the region through multilateral trade agreements. Last November, 15 Asia-Pacific nations, including China and Singapore, signed the landmark Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, despite challenging circumstances. The RCEP boosts confidence in regional trade and investment and opens up new opportunities for our businesses and peoples. This is timely as we move ahead to secure our region\u2019s recovery from the disruptive economic impact of COVID-19.\n26 I encourage China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP. Joining the CPTPP will signal China\u2019s intent to abide by higher standards of free trade and economic integration. It will have a positive impact on Asia\u2019s prosperity.\n27 The second feature of a prosperous Asia is a Green Asia. As countries around the world work to recover from COVID-19, Asia must build back cleaner and greener from the pandemic and realise our joint commitments to the Paris Agreement goals.\n28 Third, a prosperous Asia is innovative and inclusive. It is teeming with new ideas to improve the lives of its peoples. It joins hands to ensure that economic development and regional cooperation lift all boats.\n29 To make all these ideas a reality, we need the appropriate fora for Asia\u2019s leaders to come together for substantive discussion and collaboration.\n30 Both the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Plus Three Summit can play this role. They are established and inclusive multilateral platforms. But first, leaders must step up to the plate and set the agenda for cooperation. Not only as national leaders, but also as international statesmen. To propose a common vision for Asia. To tackle regional challenges together. To initiate win-win collaborations. To bring all on board with ideas for a peaceful and prosperous Asia.\n31 How can the World Peace Forum contribute towards building a peaceful and prosperous Asia? This is my suggestion. Many countries in Asia have their own annual forums and conferences that bring together top minds to discuss important regional issues. They can multiply the reach of these messages and ideas several folds if, once every two or three years, they get together to organise a joint multinational forum. This is a collaboration amongst a consortium of think tanks across Asia to promote a common vision of peace and prosperity. It will be a concrete example of reinvigorating regional cooperation. The World Peace Forum can pilot this with a small group of 4 or 5 other think tanks in the region. Think of this as a Track 2 channel which explores new ideas for regional cooperation, especially to address longer-term challenges such as green growth. Focus on quality of participation rather than quantity of attendance. The outcomes of the discussions must be such that the leaders and peoples of Asia will take notice. Hopefully, some of these ideas will be taken up in multilateral platforms like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN Plus Three Summit, and be translated into reality.\nA Peaceful and Prosperous Asia\n32 Let me conclude. I grew up in an Asia that was neither peaceful nor prosperous. Eight months after I was born, bombs were dropped on Singapore. I am grateful that we now live in a region that enjoys relative peace and moderate prosperity. But I still worry about bombs being dropped once again if relations between neighbours go wrong in the future. Hence, our work to advance regional cooperation is never done.\n33 This can be the Asian century of peace and prosperity, if first, leaders in Asia are international statesmen who look beyond their national interests; leaders who see that regional cooperation consolidates peace and advances prosperity; leaders who understand that the benefits accruing from cooperation are more than if they were to go it alone. Second, our leaders agree on a shared vision for Asia and a set of common core principles to abide by. Third, countries in the region come up with new and substantive ideas and programmes to collaborate on.\n34 Asia faces many severe challenges, including COVID-19, geopolitical rivalries and macroeconomic risks. Now, more than ever, is the time to reinvigorate regional cooperation. Only by doing so can we secure a better future for Asia. Only by doing so can we enjoy sustained peace and prosperity.\n35 Thank you.\nESM speaking at the th World Peace Forumplenary session on \u201cReinvigorating Regional Cooperation\u201d on 4 July 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore"

There are three tests in which the world has failed or is failing.\n3 The first test is that COVID-19 became a pandemic. It quickly transgressed national boundaries and established itself everywhere. Our alert systems for radical transparency and the free flow of information obviously failed. So that is one strike.\n4 The second test is whether or not COVID-19 became endemic. After it had established itself in the world, at the domestic level, there was insufficient control. We gave the virus probably more than one billion human beings in which to mutate and evolve, and we now have variants. Therefore, the second test that we have failed is that COVID-19 is now endemic. It is never going to leave us.\n5 The third test is how we are going to achieve herd immunity. By this time next year, the world will have achieved a significant level of herd immunity. The only question is, will we achieve herd immunity through infection, with all the mortalities and deaths that it entails, or will we achieve herd immunity through vaccination? These are three tests in which we are not doing well.\n6 In this room, there are at least 50 of us and we have been here for two hours. That means we have all been exposed to the same level of viral load. Let me speak to you as a doctor. The only difference is whether or not we have been wearing our masks, and whether or not we have been vaccinated. Otherwise, take it from me, we are all equally exposed.\n7 At a macroscopic level, that is the world\u2019s situation. So think about it, think about our information systems, think about our domestic systems, and think about how we are going to achieve herd immunity through effective collaboration.\n8 Thank you Luigi.\nREMARKS BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT\nG20 FOREIGN MINISTERS\u2019 MEETING\nFOOD SECURITY\nMATERA, ITALY\n29 JUNE 2021\n1 Singapore understands the gravity of food security. I speak as a country where 90 percent of our food is imported from over 170 regions. When we say supply chains, this is existential for us. Only one percent of our land is available for food production.\n2 I just want to make three quick suggestions.\nSupply Chain Connectivity\n3 First, few countries are self-sufficient in food production. Therefore, what it means is that maintaining global supply chain connectivity is essential to ensure food security for all.\n4 This is particularly important during a crisis when borders, airports, and ports quickly closed. Hence, I would like to thank G20 members Australia, Canada, China, France and Japan, who affirmed our commitments to keep food supply lines intact.\n5 Second, maintaining connectivity is also important for many livelihoods that depend on it \u2013 from farmers and fishermen to retail workers worldwide. More open, rules-based trade, and not protectionist autarky is key to support a sustainable, global recovery.\nSustainability\n6 Third, resources will always be finite but climate change has now wreaked havoc on resource availability, and scientists estimate there will be a widespread decline in crop yields of up to 25 percent by 2050, while global food demand will keep rising. These two curves suggest a crisis in the making. That is all more reason why we need to double down efforts to ensure sustainability. Agriculture and food production should be efficient and climate-friendly, with a view to maintaining a circular economy.\n7 To achieve these aims, government, scientific and private sectors must collaborate and embark on further research and innovation in agri-technology. Technical assistance and capacity building will be absolutely necessary to help developing countries leverage advances in technology to grow more with less. Let us work together to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger.\n8 Singapore has built up some knowledge in agri-technology and strengthening food security. We will continue working with the G20 and other countries, including in our capacity as Convenor of the Global Governance Group (or 3G), to strengthen multilateralism, global governance, and to enhance global food security for all.

ISIS retains a diffused global presence, exploiting the digital sphere to extend its networks and propagate extremism. Its brand of radicalism and violence persists, including in Southeast Asia. Therefore, we need to remain vigilant.\n3 Returning foreign terrorist fighters remain a clear and present danger. To prevent potential attacks, a new multilateral Counter-Terrorism Information Facility was established in Singapore this year. Like-minded countries can share intelligence, and pool monitoring and analysis capabilities through this Facility.\n4 Singapore adopts a \u201cnot if, but when\u201d approach to counter-terrorism. Extremism and radicalisation are not confined to any single religion, race, gender or age. A robust security response is essential but insufficient. We will continue to work closely with the community and religious organisations to identify radicalised individuals. We need to win hearts and minds of people around the world and around the region. We need trust and unity amongst different groups, and eliminate misperceptions or prejudice wherever they arise.\n5 Global terrorism does not respect borders, and can only be defeated through collective action. We are committed to continue working with Coalition members.\n6 Thank you.\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Rome on 28 June 2021.\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan at the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Rome on 28 June 2021.\nPhoto credit: Angelo Carconi"

We believe COVID-19 will be endemic and permanent in the human population. I just want to make three quick points.\nFirst, that COVID-19 has illustrated the urgent need for global cooperation on healthcare and vaccine distribution. Singapore is a strong supporter of vaccine multilateralism. We believe in fair and equitable distribution of vaccines. This is essential for global recovery. We have also begun discussing with many partners, including China, the mutual recognition of health certificates, in order to facilitate the safe resumption of travel, and this we believe is essential for a sustainable global recovery.\nSecond, we must advance economic integration and connectivity. Amongst the many disruptions caused by COVID-19, having stable and resilient supply chains remains key to ensuring the continued flow of essential goods and medical supplies.\n5 One good example is the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative-New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI-ILSTC), a key initiative under the CCI, Singapore\u2019s third Government-to-Government project with China. The CCI-ILSTC, which serves as a multi-modal and multi-faceted link between Southeast Asia and Western China, has proven itself to be a viable and effective alternative trade route. Despite the pandemic, this route has seen a 30 percent year\u2011on\u2011year increase in cargo flows last year. Mind you, even in the midst of a pandemic, a 30 percent increase in cargo flows. It is well\u2011positioned to further enhance connectivity across and beyond the Belt and Road.\n6 Beyond infrastructural connectivity, the Belt and Road Initiative has also fostered stronger cooperation between Singapore and China, and it includes the areas of financial connectivity; third party collaborations; and professional services, including legal and judicial cooperation.\n7 My third and final point is that we must not lose sight of the existential threat of climate change. Singapore is a strong advocate for the Paris Agreement. In fact, I can tell you from personal experience, the Paris Agreement was a key result of great collaboration among the United States, China, Europe, and the rest of the world. We believe that all of us need to seize the opportunity presented by COVID-19 to make a global reset to achieve a more sustainable future.\n8 In Singapore, we recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, outlining a whole-of-nation approach to sustainable development, and we are committed to working with partners in areas such as green finance and clean energy solutions. As Co-Chair of the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC), Singapore believes that there are many opportunities for partners to work constructively together on innovative and sustainable solutions. The decisions we make on green recovery today will have profound long\u2011term implications on future generations.\n9 Thank you very much, State Councilor."

They expressed their commitment to strengthen economic and financial cooperation under the Singapore-Vietnam Strategic Partnership which will mark its 10th anniversary in 2023. Singapore is one of the top foreign investors in Vietnam, with a cumulative investment of over US$56 billion in more than 2,600 projects. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the first Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP). Minister Balakrishnan noted that the VSIPs have attracted US$14 billion in investments and created over 270,000 jobs in Vietnam. Deputy Prime Minister Minh and Minister Balakrishnan also discussed regional developments, including ASEAN and the importance of deepening economic integration through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\nMinister Balakrishnan also delivered remarks at the High Level Opening of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD), alongside other ASEM leaders. Minister Balakrishnan emphasised that cooperation between Asia and Europe remains indispensable in the face of increasingly complex transboundary challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, and COVID-19. Minister Balakrishnan highlighted the importance of global governance, integrating economics, and maintaining free trade amid present challenges. He also underscored ASEM\u2019s crucial role in supporting multilateralism and global governance in the wake of recovery from the pandemic. Minister Balakrishnan\u2019s full remarks are appended.\nThereafter, Minister Balakrishnan met Hanoi Party Secretary Dinh Tien Dung. They discussed common challenges of local governance and urbanisation and agreed to bolster city-to-city cooperation, including in urban solutions and smart cities development. Minister Balakrishnan invited Party Secretary Dung to visit Singapore at a mutually convenient time.\nMinister Balakrishnan also met Chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam Commission for External Relations Le Hoai Trung. Chairman Trung also hosted Minister to dinner. Minister and Chairman Trung discussed ways to strengthen party-to-party relations. They also had a wide-ranging discussion on international and regional issues.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n23 JUNE 2021\nREMARKS BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AT\nASEM HIGH-LEVEL POLICY DIALOGUE\n\u201cASEM AT 25: STRENGTHENING ASIA-EUROPE PARTNERSHIP IN A TRANSFORMING WORLD\u201d\nHANOI, VIETNAM\n22 JUNE 2021, 1330HRS\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n1 Our host, Minister Bui Thanh Son, made a very important point that the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is indispensable. There are four reasons why this meeting, and this engagement is indispensable. First, we are transiting from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. In that multipolar world, Europe and Asia will play very significant roles. The second reason why ASEM is indispensable, is that we are still faced with this current emergency, this crisis due to COVID-19, and it will go on for some time. The third reason is that we are in the midst of a once in a lifetime digital revolution with a profound impact on jobs, society, and politics. The fourth reason is that there remains a clear and present danger of climate change, for which a global response is essential. And so, I submit that Mr Bui Thanh Son\u2019s description of ASEM as \u201cindispensable\u201d is absolutely spot-on.\n2 Let me quickly sketch out three challenges that we face. The first is to deal with the immediate crisis of COVID-19. COVID-19 is endemic. The possibility of it disappearing the way its predecessor, SARS did, 18 years ago \u2013 we have lost that opportunity. COVID-19 will be permanent in humanity and it will come back in recurrent waves. We need to vaccinate, to test, to isolate, and to improve therapeutics. And while significant and indeed unprecedented progress has been made \u2013 if you had asked me a year ago if we would have vaccines within a year, as a doctor I would have told you that it was impossible. But the impossible has occurred. What we are witnessing now is great asymmetry, for instance, in the distribution of vaccination. Asymmetry ranging from some countries\u2019 vaccination rates of more than 70 or even 80 percent, and some countries with less than one percent vaccination rates.\n3 The second challenge we face is economics. COVID-19 decimated economic activity across the world. Because we all needed to impose some form of generalised lockdown, there was a very heavy price paid by all our people. There will be recovery this year, but again, just like the vaccination story, we are going to witness asymmetry in the pace of recovery. We need to make sure that we do not end up with another stratified world in the way we recover post-COVID-19.\n4 The third, and perhaps the most painful challenge, is to recognise the crisis of global governance. If we cast our minds back to a year ago and recall the missed opportunities, the failure to coordinate, and the way the virus was allowed to escape into our populations and become endemic, and the failure to coordinate at a global level, I am afraid history will judge this generation harshly. If that was not enough, we also witnessed disruption of global supply chains, xenophobia, racism, and rising hyper-nationalism. What we thought was an interconnected happy village in fact turned out to be the opposite. In the face of these current and ongoing challenges, where does ASEM fit in? I think there is quite a lot that we can do.\n5 On health, the cooperation between Asia and Europe is absolutely critical. ASEM issued the COVID-19 Ministerial Statement last year, which reaffirmed our commitment to strengthening dialogue and cooperation. But it was not just about words and pious aspirations. In fact, when you look at reality, Europe and China were the largest exporters of vaccines in the last few months. I give credit to Europe for being a reliable exporter of vaccines and honouring contracts, even when Europe itself was not fully vaccinated. Europe needs to be commended for its commitment to a rules-based system of honouring contracts and its understanding that the world would not be safe unless all of us were safe. I am glad that we all supported the COVAX facility. Singapore was a co-founder of the informal Friends of COVAX facility. Vaccine multilateralism is essential.\n6 On the economic front, ASEM partners have continued to do our best to keep our economies open, to integrate our economies, and to continue to stand for the cause of free trade despite the political opposition accentuated by the fears brought on by COVID-19. On this point, it is worth reflecting that in just the last one or two years, the eleven of us proceeded through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) even without the United States. Vietnam and Singapore have ratified the CPTPP. I am glad that the United Kingdom has expressed interest in joining the CPTPP. And last year, ASEAN, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) \u2013 probably the world\u2019s largest free trade agreement. The EU signed a free trade agreement with Singapore, and a separate free trade agreement with Vietnam. And EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice President of the European Commission Josep Borrell would know that I have been encouraging the EU to explore an EU-ASEAN free trade agreement. In this day and age, standing up for free trade, negotiating, signing, ratifying, and trying to convince our domestic constituencies that free trade works and delivers for all our people is a political challenge. It is one which all politicians in this room need to fulfil.\n7 Next, as vaccinations roll out and immunity levels around the world rise either by infection or vaccination \u2013 hopefully the latter because the mortality rates with infection cannot be ignored. The point is, the world will restart and our people will insist on resuming their lives. The question then is how we will reopen, allow travel, and reconnect our economies and our supply chains, and perhaps even build new capillaries. That means interoperability of our systems, mutual recognition of health and vaccine certificates, and the ability to verify across boundaries and across national systems. Speaking of connections between regions, I want to welcome the recent conclusion of the ASEAN-EU Comprehensive Air Travel Arrangement (CATA). This is the first time ever that two regions have signed a bloc-to-bloc air travel agreement. Given the battered state of aviation and airlines in the last one and a half years, I think this is a much-needed shot in the arm for aviation industries.\n8 Another point \u2013 we do need to strengthen multilateralism. Not just because it is a nice-sounding word, but because we are transiting into a multipolar world. If we are to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last century, we need multilateralism and a rules-based system that works effectively. Now more than ever before, we need effective multilateral institutions including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These remain essential avenues to advance our shared interests. And here again, ASEM leaders, because of our instinctive support for multilateralism and a rules-based system, can play an invaluable role to support these institutions. This is the only way which we can secure peace and achieve prosperity in a world which would otherwise historically be at a very dangerous phase of transition. We do need greater international cooperation. There is no shortage of transboundary challenges. We have climate change looming over us, and cyberthreats emerging. Just as we become more dependent on our digital systems, the cyberthreats and cybercrimes become even more critical threats to our way of life and prosperity.\n9 Let me conclude that if you had any doubts, let me put them to rest. The engagement between Europe and Asia is more relevant and essential than ever before. I thank you all for your support over the past 25 years. Let us look forward to another 25 years with hope, confidence and solidarity. Thank you all very much.\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\u2019s call on Vietnam Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (left), with United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Dominic Raab (second from left), Vietnam Minister of Foreign Affairs Bui Thanh Son (second from right) and Republic of Korea Minister of Foreign Affairs Chung Eui-yong (right) at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) High Level Policy Dialogue on 22 June 2021\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) High Level Policy Dialogue on 22 June 2021\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan delivering remarks at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) High Level Policy Dialogue on 22 June 2021\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan's call on Hanoi Party Secretary Dinh Tien Dung\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan's meeting with Communist Party of Vietnam Commission for External Relations Chairman Le Hoai Trung\nPhoto credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore"

Driven by their mutual support for practical action on climate change, and building on progress under the 2020 MOU on low emissions solutions, the Australian and Singaporean governments will join business in a public-private partnership on low emissions maritime and shipping, with a combined initial contribution of up to A$30 million. The initiative will see business and government in Australia and Singapore work together on low emissions fuels and technologies, including clean hydrogen and clean ammonia, to drive down emissions in maritime shipping and port operations.\nb. Both sides will start discussions on an Australia-Singapore FinTech Bridge. The FinTech Bridge will enhance cooperation on FinTech policy and regulation and look for opportunities for collaboration on joint innovation projects, as well as facilitate investments and new business opportunities in digital trade and financial services. The FinTech Bridge will build on the strong foundations of the Digital Economy Agreement between the two countries.\nc. Both health ministries have signed a new MOU to enhance cooperation on healthcare and health technologies, which will facilitate deeper exchanges of information, knowledge and expertise to support timely and affordable access to medicines and health technologies for Singaporeans and Australians.\nd. The Australian Federal Police and Singapore\u2019s Home Team Science and Technology Agency have agreed to sign an MOU on operational science and technology cooperation to develop and enhance capabilities for homeland security and law enforcement agencies to prevent crime and maintain law and order.\ne. Singapore Symphony Orchestra and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra will renew their MOU on cooperation as an important marker that despite the pandemic, our cultural exchanges continue to flourish through innovative and digital ways of working and performing together.\nThe Prime Ministers also exchanged views on regional cooperation and international issues. They discussed COVID-19\u2019s impact on communities, health systems, economies and supply chains. They agreed to continue to share best practices in tackling the pandemic, work closely together to keep markets open and supply chains functioning, and support regional efforts for a sustainable and resilient recovery. They reiterated their commitment to the region\u2019s access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, including through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.\nThe Prime Ministers recognised that a strong, cohesive, and responsive ASEAN is vital to the region\u2019s success and recovery.

They also welcomed the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement, as a signal of support for the multilateral rules-based trading system underlining the importance of free and open trade and investment for COVID-19 recovery, and urged continued efforts by RCEP signatories to ensure the entry into force of the RCEP by 1 January 2022.\nThe Prime Ministers shared their concerns on developments in Myanmar and called for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all political detainees including foreigners, and inclusive dialogue between all parties. They agreed that ASEAN could play an important role in facilitating a peaceful solution in Myanmar and called for implementation of the Five-Point Consensus on Myanmar adopted at the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting on 24 April 2021, as soon as possible. They reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintain and promote peace, security and stability in the region, as well as the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),which is universal in character and sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. They underlined Australia and Singapore\u2019s strong support for freedom of navigation, overflight and unimpeded trade in the South China Sea. They also emphasised the importance of non-militarisation of disputed features and self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability. They urged all claimants to take meaningful steps to ease tensions and build trust, including through dialogue. They acknowledged work towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and emphasised the importance of the Code being effective and consistent with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. They agreed Australia and Singapore would remain in close contact on regional issues.\nPhoto CaptionThe 6th Singapore-Australia Leaders\u2019 Meeting at the Istana on 10 June 2021\nPhoto Credit Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto CaptionPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s Joint Press Conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the Istana on 10 June 2021\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore"

The AC Chairmanship was handed over to Russia for the term 2021 to 2023.\nSMS Sim delivered a statement expressing Singapore\u2019s readiness to continue working with Arctic States and the incoming AC Chair Russia on issues such as sustainable development, providing assistance to the Arctic Indigenous Peoples, youth engagement, and the conservation of Arctic flora and fauna. Singapore\u2019s statement is appended.\nAs a low-lying coastal state, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels; the Arctic is a barometer of climate change. Singapore contributes to the climate change agenda by participating in high-level international Arctic events, and raising regional awareness of Arctic issues. This is the fourth time Singapore has attended the AC Ministerial Meeting. Since joining the AC as an Observer State in 2013, Singapore has been supporting the sustainable development of the Arctic. This includes active participation in various AC Working Groups, and sharing Singapore\u2019s best practices and knowledge in areas such as preventing oil spills, conserving biodiversity, marine shipping, and sustainable energy development.\nThe AC is the leading intergovernmental forum for discussing political, economic, environmental and scientific issues concerning the governments and inhabitants of the Arctic region.

Its Chairmanship focus on \u201cTowards a Sustainable Arctic\u201d, not only reflects Iceland\u2019s commitment to sustainable development; it also highlights the need for closer cooperation between Arctic States, people of the region, and stakeholders beyond.\nSince joining the Arctic Council as an Observer State in 2013, Singapore has been supporting the sustainable development of the Arctic, including through active participation in various Council Working Groups, and sharing Singapore\u2019s best practices and knowledge in areas such as preventing oil spills, conserving biodiversity, marine shipping, and sustainable energy development. In the area of Arctic research, Singapore has contributed to the scientific discourse on Arctic shipping governance; carbon cycling of permafrost soils; and sea-level change in the Arctic. In addition, we continue to offer a technical cooperation package to enhance human resource development and governance capacities for the Permanent Participants.\nSingapore looks forward to closely working with the incoming Russian Chair to contribute meaningfully to the work of the Council. Sustainable development is one important area that requires collaboration from all stakeholders, which we have emphasised in the recently launched Singapore Green Plan 2030. In line with this, we look forward to supporting the work of sustainable development of the Arctic and environmental issues such as marine litter and green shipping. We will endeavour to continue improving the quality of life of the Indigenous Peoples through relevant technical cooperation programmes for Permanent Participants. The Council can also count on Singapore\u2019s active participation in the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Working Group on the Arctic Migratory Birds Initiative (AMBI) project. With a growing number of Singaporean youths taking an interest in the Arctic, we will also explore possible synergies to strengthen the Arctic Council\u2019s youth engagement.\nLast, but not least, Singapore would like to congratulate the Arctic Council on its 25th anniversary. Over the past two decades, the Council has successfully performed its role as the leading intergovernmental forum in promoting cooperation in the Arctic. Singapore stands ready to work with the Council and all stakeholders to strengthen international collaboration and address current and emerging issues to find a common way towards a sustainably prosperous Arctic.\nThank you."

The delegation also spoke about the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore and our inclusive human-centered response. In addition, the delegation briefed UN member states on the policies that Singapore had implemented since the last UPR in 2016 to advance the well-being of our citizens and achieve a more inclusive, cohesive and resilient society such as increasing access to quality and affordable preschools, increasing support for persons with disabilities, enacting the Vulnerable Adults Act, and building trust and understanding between our various communities.\n140 States spoke at the UPR. Numerous States across all regional groupings commended Singapore\u2019s social-economic policies to improve care for children and youth, older persons, and persons with disability, and enhance the right to education, the protection of women\u2019s rights, racial and religious harmony, and accessibility of healthcare services. They also acknowledged Singapore\u2019s COVID-19 response, in particular, Singapore\u2019s measures to protect vulnerable groups and ensure the well-being of migrant workers. In addition, they welcomed Singapore\u2019s ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\nSome States recommended that Singapore abolish the death penalty, corporal punishment, and section 377A of the Penal Code, as well as continue to combat human trafficking. Several States also called on Singapore to accede to more human rights treaties. Some States also recommended that Singapore do more to ensure the right to freedom of expression and assembly. The delegation explained the unique circumstances under which Singapore\u2019s policies operate as well as the rationale of our policies on these issues. The delegation also highlighted that the freedom of expression and of assembly are fundamental liberties guaranteed under the Singapore Constitution, and reaffirmed Singapore\u2019s commitment to free and responsible speech.\nSingapore remains committed to the UPR process, which is an opportunity to take stock of our progress and engage with other States on issues regardless of any differences in approaches as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the realisation of human rights. We will examine the recommendations received, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, and consider how they can be implemented and best contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights in Singapore.\nSingapore\u2019s delegation to the UPR comprised officials from 12 Government ministries and agencies.

        "content": "QUESTIONS\nMs Sylvia Lim: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the Ministry's latest assessment of the political situation in Myanmar; and (b) how best can ASEAN and Singapore contribute towards the well-being of the people of Myanmar.\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs following the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting on 24 April 2021 (a) what further actions will now be taken by ASEAN to ensure that the Myanmar military will work towards a peaceful and democratic resolution of the political crisis; and (b) what does Singapore hope for ASEAN to achieve and what is the expected time frame.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian BalakrishnanI seek your permission to respond to questions by Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Dennis Tan on how ASEAN and Singapore can address the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, in light of the ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting (ALM), which took place on 24 April 2021.\n2 The situation in Myanmar remains fraught with ongoing fatalities, increased clashes between the Tatmadaw and the Ethnic Armed Organisations, and the severe COVID-19 pandemic. According to the UN, more than 700 people have been killed since 1 February. President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other political detainees remain under detention. Protests against the military are continuing. This points to an increasingly intractable situation that threatens to further disrupt regional stability.\nOur immediate priority remains the de-escalation of the situation in Myanmar, particularly the cessation of violence that has caused the tragic loss of civilian lives. The ALM in Jakarta on 24 April 2021 was a positive initial step. The resulting Five-Point Consensus calls for: First, the immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar, and for all parties to exercise utmost restraint. Second, the commencement of constructive dialogue among all parties concerned, to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of the people. Third, a special envoy of the ASEAN Chair, assisted by the Secretary-General of ASEAN, to facilitate mediation of the dialogue process. Fourth, ASEAN to provide humanitarian assistance through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre). Fifth, the special envoy and delegation to visit Myanmar and meet with all parties concerned. The Chairman\u2019s Statement on the ALM also called for the release of all political prisoners.\nASEAN\u2019s immediate task is to implement the Five-Point Consensus. This will not be an easy process. The cooperation of the Tatmadaw will be needed. There are many details to be worked out, including nominating an envoy or a team of ASEAN envoys, their terms of reference, as well as working out how and when to disburse humanitarian assistance. ASEAN will also have to continue to speak collectively to urge the Myanmar military authorities to uphold the consensus \u2013 particularly to exercise maximum restraint and begin meaningful dialogue with all parties concerned. ASEAN must also continue to call for the release of all political detainees, notably President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.\nWhile the ALM represented an initial step, the path back to normalcy in Myanmar will be a long and difficult one. As I have said before, the long-term and sustainable resolution of the current crisis ultimately lies with the Myanmar people. The key stakeholders in Myanmar must negotiate, find a compromise and formulate a durable political solution. Ultimately, it is their political will to do what is right for the people of Myanmar that would determine how quickly a solution can be found. ASEAN can only help to facilitate this dialogue and support the process.\nAt the same time, Singapore and ASEAN must continue to work with and complement the efforts by the UN and other international bodies, including the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy on Myanmar Ms Christine Schraner Burgener. Other countries like China, the US, India, Japan, and other Dialogue Partners of ASEAN also have important roles to play given their considerable influence over the various actors in this crisis.\nSingapore will continue to do what we can to support ASEAN\u2019s efforts in facilitating a return to normalcy, peace and stability in Myanmar, including through the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. We hope that wisdom and good sense will prevail, and we stand ready to do our part.\nQUESTION\nMiss Cheng Li Hui: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what is the specific assistance that Singapore has offered to other countries to deal with COVID-19; and (b) how has Singapore assisted India as it confronts its latest wave of the pandemic.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian BalakrishnanIt has been more than a year since the first known cases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, despite important progress such as the rapid development of several vaccines, we are seeing the emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and renewed waves of cases and deaths being reported across the globe. As I have mentioned previously, this is a virus that does not discriminate across language, race, religion, or borders. Multilateralism and international cooperation are, therefore, vital elements in our response to the pandemic, since no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n2 During the Committee of Supply Debate on 1 March 2021, I explained that no matter how well we control the pandemic within our borders, life cannot resume and get back to the status quo unless the rest of the world is also made safer. This is why Singapore was an early supporter of the COVAX Facility, which is the flagship global mechanism to facilitate access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries. We founded, and we co-chair the informal Friends of the COVAX Facility (FOF), a 15-member group, to catalyse discussions on the operationalisation of the COVAX Facility. COVAX\u2019s primary value is in ensuring that subsidised vaccines will be allocated to 92 low and lower-middle income countries. Singapore has contributed US$5 million to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) towards this purpose. In less than three months, the COVAX Facility has delivered more than 49 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to over 120 countries. The world would be collectively worse off without COVAX.\nTo support regional efforts to combat the virus, Singapore has contributed US$100,000 to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund. The Fund will be used to procure medical equipment and other supplies for frontline response and preventative measures, as well as to finance long-term research and development of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Notably, with further contributions from ASEAN Dialogue Partners, US$10.5 million of this Fund will also be used for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines for ASEAN Member States and the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.\nIn addition, our role as a transit hub has enabled us to help repatriate other countries\u2019 nationals, even as commercial flight connections are affected by global travel restrictions. As a result, many were able to go home and be reunited with their families and loved ones. In turn, Singaporeans have also benefited from similar assistance provided by our friends around the world.\nWe also offered what we can to our neighbours and partners around the world while taking care of our domestic needs. Singapore has provided critical medical supplies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines, diagnostic test kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), oximeters, surgical masks, hand sanitisers, thermometers and oxygen-related supplies to our friends in the region including Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, China and India, as well as those further away like Fiji, Palau, Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda. We are also planning to donate medical supplies to countries in Latin America, such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru and Ecuador. Looking ahead, Singapore will continue to assist countries in need within our means during this challenging time.\nThe Singapore Government\u2019s international assistance during this pandemic has also served as a catalyst for wider efforts within our community. We have witnessed a wide range of contributions from private sector entities and philanthropic organisations in Singapore. The Singapore Government had provided seed funding to the Singapore Red Cross Society (SRC)\u2019s fundraising effort for humanitarian assistance to affected communities in China. This fundraising drive raised more than S$6 million. The SRC has also coordinated the supply of medical aid worth S$900,000 to other countries. In addition, the Temasek Foundation has to date donated diagnostic test kits, oxygen concentrators, and BiPAP machines to over 30 countries around the world.\nSingapore\u2019s contributions to India have been addressed by the Written Answer to Question 8 given on 10 May 2021.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n11 MAY 2021"

        "content": "QUESTION\nMr Ang Wei Neng: To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he can provide an update on the assistance that Singapore has provided to India due to its worsening COVID-19 infections.\nREPLY\nDr Vivian BalakrishnanThe resurgence of COVID-19 cases and evolution of multiple variants poses a global challenge. The virus does not discriminate across language, race, religion, or national borders; it is therefore in our collective interest to help one another because no one is safe until everyone is safe. India has been hit especially hard due to their recent second wave, exacerbated by the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more transmissible. Countries around the world are rallying together to work with India to alleviate the critical situation. India is a close friend and partner of Singapore, and many Singaporeans have families and friends there. Singapore is committed to doing our part to contribute to these efforts.\nI have been in contact with Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar and our officials have been working to ensure that our efforts to help would be rapid, targeted, and practical. On 28 April 2021, the Singapore Government sent a consignment of 256 oxygen cylinders to support India\u2019s pandemic response. These were flown directly to West Bengal in India via two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C-130 aircraft. There is a critical need for oxygen-related supplies in India, especially in the areas of oxygen storage and last-mile delivery to hospitals around the country. Our modest assistance was aimed at supporting this critical and urgent area of need and we hope that it provided some relief to those battling the pandemic on the frontlines. Singapore was amongst the first countries to send oxygen cylinders to India.\nIn addition, we are facilitating India\u2019s efforts to procure COVID-19 supplies and equipment through Singapore-based entities or by providing transport and logistical support. For example, we are supporting ongoing efforts by the Indian Air Force to airlift cryogenic tanks from Singapore in several batches, and facilitating Indian naval ships coming to Singapore to pick up relief supplies.\nThis has not only been a Singapore Government effort. Many Singapore-based private sector entities and other civil society organisations are also playing an important part in providing assistance to India. For example, the Temasek Foundation has sent urgent relief supplies and essential medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators, oximeters and ventilators. It is working with Indian partners to ensure that these are distributed to areas in need. Singapore Airlines has helped to airlift these items to India. Many people and companies have generously reached out and indicated their interest in contributing to relief efforts. The Singapore Red Cross has launched a fundraiser and is currently coordinating contributions from the public and private sector entities. These resources will go towards procuring and distributing the necessary medical supplies and equipment to India.\nWe will continue to work with our Indian friends during this difficult time and explore various avenues to help in areas that we can.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n10 MAY 2021"

This is his first Official Visit to Singapore in his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nForeign Minister Hishammuddin called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean.

They welcomed further exchanges between the Ministers and officials of both sides to strengthen cooperation in confronting the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nForeign Minister Hishammuddin also met Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan. They had fruitful discussions on bilateral cooperation, including the importance of re-opening our borders in a gradual and safe manner, given our extensive economic and people-to-people linkages. The two Foreign Ministers agreed to formalise a framework for cross-border travel for compassionate reasons. Minister Balakrishnan and Minster Hishammuddin also welcomed the agreement reached by the Singapore Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation on the mutual technical verification of health certificates issued in Singapore and Malaysia, which will facilitate discussions on cross-border travel arrangements for our peoples in the future.\nMinister Balakrishnan will join Foreign Minister Hishammuddin in the breaking of his fast this evening, following which Foreign Minister Hishammuddin and his delegation will return to Malaysia.\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSINGAPORE\n2 MAY 2021\nPhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, SingaporePhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, SingaporePhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, SingaporePhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein with Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, SingaporePhoto Caption: Meeting between Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SingaporePhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein speak to the media after their meeting on 2 May 2021.Photo Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein called on Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein with Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Meeting between Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nPhoto Caption: Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein speak to the media after their meeting on 2 May 2021.\nPhoto Credit: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\nJOINT STATEMENT\nDR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN\nMINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nOF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE\nAND\nDATO\u2019 SERI HISHAMMUDDIN TUN HUSSEIN\nMINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nOF MALAYSIA\nSINGAPORE\n2 MAY 2021\nEDITED TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN AND MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF MALAYSIADATO\u2019 SERI HISHAMMUDDIN TUN HUSSEIN, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE, 2 MAY 2021 AT 1116 HRS\nMinister Dato\u2019 Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein: At the outset I would like to thank Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, for inviting me over today. And I am very happy to have our delegation here. But it is important for me to announce that, unfortunately, plans for my Prime Minister to undertake an Official Visit to Singapore tomorrow have to be postponed. One, because of the current focus that he has, to address the rising COVID-19 numbers in Malaysia. And secondly, a lot of the discussions between the two Prime Ministers, we were hoping \u2013 Vivian and I \u2013 would have revolved around the gradual resumption of cross-border travel, and the ease of movement between our citizens. And our hope was that it could have been decided at the very highest level between the two Prime Ministers during my Prime Minister's Official Visit tomorrow. But bearing in mind the current COVID-19 situation, it does not provide the right environment for both Prime Ministers to discuss that particular matter.\nAnd we have to stress that it is very challenging for both sides to come up with a concrete and safe solution on cross-border movements at the moment, and to frame what we could announce to the public. So, we both felt that it would be much more opportune for the two Prime Ministers to meet at a slightly later date, on a more appropriate time, when we can announce this very important and much awaited decision by both countries.\nNotwithstanding, Vivian and I will continue with our negotiations. I do not need to go into details. But for cross-border movements, I am happy to announce together with Vivian, that the Death and Critically Ill Emergency Visits arrangement has been concluded, and we hope to implement it by 17 May 2021, this month. It will require the agencies to finalise certain details. Reciprocal Green Lane and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement was also discussed. The Air Travel Bubble will require further negotiations between the Transport Ministries on both sides. Mutual recognition of vaccination certificates, recognition digitally, is underway. MySejahtera and TraceTogether will need to be compatible.\nWe hope that by the time the two Prime Ministers meet, whether at the end of the year during the informal meeting, or maybe in time when our situation permits earlier, Tan Sri Muhyiddin would be able to make an official visit to Singapore.\nFinally, the both of us discussed the situation in Myanmar, what was achieved in Jakarta recently by the leaders of ASEAN, and how we have to make sure that the five points that had been agreed upon continues to be worked on, and (that we continue our) engagement with all the relevant stakeholders. We were very pleased with the outcome in Jakarta, but still a lot of work needs to be done in finding the way forward with regard to what has been unfolding in Myanmar. Thank you.\nMinister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: Thank you, Hisham. Let me first say how glad I am to welcome Dato\u2019 Seri Hisham to Singapore. This is his first official visit as the Foreign Minister of Malaysia.\nThe second point I want to make is that I understand the reasons for the postponement of Prime Minister Muhyiddin\u2019s visit to Singapore. I think given the volatile nature of the COVID-19 situation on both sides, it makes sense to focus primarily on the domestic control of the pandemic,whilst Dato\u2019 Seri Hisham and I continue to do our homework on the parameters for the schemes that can be announced later.\nAs far as today is concerned, I think Dato\u2019 Seri Hisham has already announced that we have settled the details for the compassionate travel scheme, and that will begin on 17 May 2021. This is a scheme which is needed because of the extensive ties of kinship between Malaysia and Singapore \u2013 parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, and cousins. When family crises occur, people want to get together. Therefore, bearing in mind this very special and close relationship between the people of Singapore and the people of Malaysia, it is necessary to have schemes like this. We will announce further details on the types of tests and quarantine arrangements, which will be necessary in order to operationalise this scheme.\nWork is also going on for the mutual recognition of health certificates. This is with respect to vaccination records and Polymerase Chain Reaction test records. That is well underway at a technical level. All this is preparation for the future, when the situation improves in both Malaysia and Singapore, and travel can be liberalised further than where it is now.\nAnother point worth emphasising is that if you look back over the past one year, no matter how bad things got \u2013 either in Malaysia or in Singapore \u2013 we have never completely closed the borders. Our essential supply chains, the lorries delivering important medication, food, and other supplies, have continued to flow. That is why we have also made the extra effort to vaccinate the Malaysian truck drivers. This is something which I had discussed beforehand with you and I got your agreement for. These are examples, again, of the very special relationship between Malaysia \u2013 and obviously especially Johor \u2013 and Singapore, and why we have to continue to make special arrangements for this special relationship to continue, even in times of crisis.\nAll in all, I am very glad that you are here, and to welcome you back to Singapore. We have known each other for two decades, and I can assure you that we will continue to work very closely together even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge both our countries. Rest assured, we will work very closely together, we will support each other, and our people-to-people ties will be protected and nurtured. Thank you all very much."

Thank you for being here this morning to witness the handover of two planeloads of oxygen-related humanitarian assistance to support India\u2019s ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. I would just like to make a couple of points.\nFirst, we have all witnessed in the past year how this pandemic is a transboundary threat. It gives no regard for country, nationality, or race. This is exactly why we must work collectively to support each other.\nSecond, what we see here today is a testament to the excellent relations between Singapore and India. This is made possible because of the existing close relationship between our two peoples, our governments, and our countries. I would like to thank the government of India for continuing to work with Singapore throughout this pandemic, keeping the supply chains open and essential goods flowing.\nThird, I have no doubt that the fighting spirit of the Indian people will prevail. We have witnessed India\u2019s immense capabilities in mobilising her people and resources when challenges arise. While our contribution is modest, we hope that it will bring comfort and relief to those in need and encourage those on the frontline in India, who are working tirelessly, to fight on.\nIn addition, we hope that this will add momentum to the work undertaken by Singaporeans, our private entities, our civil society organisations, including the Singapore Red Cross, to contribute to India\u2019s efforts against COVID-19.\nIn closing, we wish India success in her fight against the pandemic.

On behalf of the people of Singapore, I extend my condolences to Your Majesty and the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was an exemplary role model for the British people, and served the United Kingdom selflessly and with honour for over six decades. Singapore will always fondly remember the State Visit by Your Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh to Singapore in 2006, as well as the generosity and warmth His Royal Highness had shown to our former President Dr Tony Tan, during Singapore\u2019s first-ever State Visit to the United Kingdom in 2014.\nThe many decades of public service of His Royal Highness will continue to inspire successive generations of young people, and live on in the memories of many around the world.\nOur thoughts are with Your Majesty and the Royal Family during this time of mourning.\nYours sincerely\nHALIMAH YACOB\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales\n10 April 2021\nYour Royal Highness,\nI was saddened to learn of the passing of your father, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\nAs we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.\nOne of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore\u2019s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992.\nIt was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989. He also met students from the Singapore Sports School during Her Majesty The Queen\u2019s State Visit in 2006, where I had the great pleasure to meet him.\nOn behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you my deepest condolences and sympathies for this immense loss. He will be remembered and missed.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nHis Royal Highness The Prince of Wales\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nLetter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n10 April 2021\nDear Prime Minister Johnson,\nOn behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you and your Government my deep condolences on the passing of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\nThroughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day.\nWe have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.\nYours sincerely,\nLEE HSIEN LOONG\nThe Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP\nPrime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, and Minister for the Union\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"
